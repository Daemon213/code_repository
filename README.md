## 🚀 Usage

Most files in this repository are intended to be "quoted" or uploaded into a running MU* server.

1.  **Navigate** to the directory containing the system you need.
2.  **Review** the file content for any specific configuration settings (e.g., `#define` constants or attribute settings).
3.  **Upload**: Use your preferred MU* client (such as Potato, TinyFugue, or MUSHclient) to quote the text into the game. 
    * *Note: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions (usually Wizard or Royalty) if the code requires setting restricted flags.*
