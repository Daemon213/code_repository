DESCRIPTION: The first class of MUSHCoding 101 PART 3 ever held. Most of
it has been left in its original state, though some parts of the log were
edited to remove spam or correct a speaker's typo. A '*' has been placed in
front of the speaker's name.

Luigi's Classroom
..is a pit. @Dolists and iter()'s float about, encapsulating each other, and
surrounding and being surrounded by a plethora of other functions and @commands.
It's a mess. Some of the code here is scribbled on walls and notebook paper, while
even more of it is written on the windows with crayons or scratched into the floors.
Madness. You wonder how you'll ever learn how to code now.

Phil_Laco fire spitball at Faizah's forehead.
Phil_Laco has left.
Xeiran says, "I sure wish I could have made my frame one..."
Xeiran says, "Um, Luigi, how do you make animations?"
* Luigi says,, "Alright, is everyone ready to begin?"
Faizah says, "Hang on. Want to show all 3 stages of my plant."

Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi(#6173V)
You see a small plant, growing out of a clay pot. It looks about 99 centimeters
tall.

You may like to water it to make it grow.
Phil_Laco has arrived.
Xeiran waters the redwood. It grows to be gigantic!
Faizah says, "This is the small one."
Xeiran digs back up the tree seed.
Faizah waters the plant, and it grows a little.

Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi(#6173V)
The plant is precisely 1 meter tall. It looks to be a small tree of some kind.

Faizah says, "The 1-meter one."
Faizah waters the plant, and it grows a little.
Xeiran says, "This is what it shows when you dig up the redwood :) "You grab a shovel
and dig at the redwood's base, finally crouching down, and coming up triumphantly with
the seed, grinning at no one in particular. Meanwhile, the redwood topples over and
smashes some old lady in a wheelchair. Oops.""
Faizah says, "The adult one"
Phil_Laco has left.
Faizah says, "That's my tree thing. Heh."
* Luigi says,, "Good job."
Xeiran says, "Heheh"
Faizah says, "Not much, but I like the descs."
Rhayden's plant had pictures
Xeiran says, "I think mine would have gotten a pretty good rating, if my picture hadn't
screwed up"
* Luigi says,, "I'll grade them later. Can we begin?"
Xeiran says, "Yes, let's go"
Faizah says, "I'm ready"
Rhayden says, "Time to learn"
* Luigi says,, "The first week we discussed Commands and Functions. Such as @create,
add(), and so forth. We also talked about $-commands, or user-defined commands, the
format being &<attribute> <object>=$<command>:<what to do when this command is typed>."
* Luigi says,, "The second week we discussed @Wipe, @Destroy, and most importantly,
@Switch."
* Luigi says,, "We also discussed @Listen and @Ahear."
* Luigi says,, "For review, @Switch uses the following format:"
Faizah grins. Heh. @listen and @ahear was fun.
* Luigi says,, "@Switch <what to switch on>=<if this>,<then this>"
Xeiran says, "Don't forget, <else this>"
* Luigi says,, "You may have as many <if this>,<then this>'s as you wish, and may end
with a {} which is what happens if none of the others match. See the logs of last
week's for more detail on this."
* Luigi says,, "@Listen is simply a wildcard, such as: * says, "*""
* Luigi says,, "Whenever the object 'hears' something that matches this, it runs the
@Ahear."
Rhayden nods.
* Luigi says,, "We set a @Switch on the ahead, that did something different depending
on if they said 'hi' or 'bye', if you'll remember."
* Luigi says,, "Let's continue our discussion on @Listen."
* Luigi says,, "There may be cases where @Ahear isn't what you want to use. There is
also an @Amhear and a @Aahear."
* Luigi says,, "@Ahear is triggered when @Listen matches on something NOT owned by the
thing the @Listen is on."
Rhayden says, "Isn't that @amhear?"
* Luigi says,, "Let's say we have an object listening for "hi". If the object itself
said "hi", it wouldn't trigger it."
* Luigi says,, "@Amhear, on the other hand, triggers ONLY what the object says. So
unless the object itself said "hi", it wouldn't trigger it."
* Luigi says,, "Lastly, @Aahear triggers from everything."
* Luigi says,, "@Ahear is the most commonly used."
* Luigi says,, "Create a new object. Parrot."
* Luigi says,, "@Listen Parrot=*"
Kronus has arrived.
Kronus sneaks in quitely and sits down...
* Luigi types --> @ahear parrot=say Bawk! %0;@ahear me
Faizah names hers FizP'rot. Just cause. Heh.
* Luigi says,, "Then drop your parrot, and say something. You will have to re-set the
@ahear each time you want it to do it once, as every time it matches something it does
"@ahear me" which erases the @ahear."
RhayParrot has arrived.
Rhayden drops RhayParrot.
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! Dropped."
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! Luigi's Classroom"
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! ..is a pit. @Dolists and iter()'s float about, encapsulating

FizP'rot says, "Bawk! Luigi says, "Re set the @ahear on the parrots, and try saying
something.""
Faizah says, "Hello"
Xeiran drops Pollyanna.
Xeiran says, "Hey"
FizP'rot says, "Bawk! Xeiran says, "Hey""
Faizah says, "Hello"
* Luigi says,, "The only reason I put "@ahear me" in there is so it wouldn't keep
triggering off all of the other parrots, thus spamming us senseless."
* Luigi says,, "Do you understand?"
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! Luigi says, "Do you understand?""
* Luigi grins.
Xeiran says, "What I did was @set Pollyanna to halt before I dropped her, then set
!halt"
Faizah grins.
Xeiran says, "Understand, I do"
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! Xeiran says, "Understand, I do""
* Luigi says,, "Yes, you can @halt things and then type '@set <object>=!halt'. Haven't
talked about this yet, but it exists."
RhayParrot says, "Bwak! Luigi says, "Yes, you can @halt things and then type '@set
<object>=!halt'. Haven't talked about this yet, but it exists.""
Xeiran says, "Yeah, shutup ya little featherball"
* Luigi says,, "Alright, please pick up your objects. Any questions about @Ahear,
@Amhear, and @Aahear before we move on?"
Xeiran takes Pollyanna.
FizP'rot has left.
Faizah takes FizP'rot.
Xeiran raises a hand.
* Luigi says,, "Yes, Xeiran?"
RhayParrot has left.
Rhayden takes RhayParrot.
Xeiran says, "If a robot hears itself and responds, does it keep saying the same thing?"
* Luigi says,, "A robot?"
Xeiran says, "Er"
Xeiran says, "Object"
Xeiran says, "If an object hears itself, does it keep responding or what"
Rhayden says, "Depends if your @aahear/@amhear sends itself into an infinite loop"
* Luigi says,, "It depends on if it is hearing itself say what matches to its @listen."
Rhayden says, "Hear "this". Say "this"."
* Luigi says,, "@listen <object>=*corn* and @amhear <object>=say corn, would loop."
Xeiran says, "Aha, okay. Echo-chamber style. >:)"
* Luigi says,, "Next, we move back into @Switch."
* Luigi says,, "A very important command we covered last class, I want to cover another
couple of features it has."
Faizah takes Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi.
Faizah gave you Faizah's Plant H/W to Luigi.
* Luigi says,, "As you should recall, @Switch can use wildcards."
Rhayden nods.
Faizah nodnods.
* Luigi types --> @Switch corn=*orn,{say Had "orn" in it!}
* Luigi says,, "Had "orn" in it!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch lorn=*orn,{say Had "orn" in it!}
* Luigi says,, "Had "orn" in it!"
* Luigi says,, "@Switch can also do something cool when the thing being switch on is a
number."
* Luigi says,, "Behold:"
* Luigi types --> @Switch 3=>3,{say Greater than three!},<3,{say Less than
three!},3,{say Three exactly!}
* Luigi says,, "Three exactly!"
teach @Switch 2=>3,{say Greater than three!},<3,{say Less than three!},3,{say Three
exactly!}
* Luigi types --> @Switch 2=>3,{say Greater than three!},<3,{say Less than
three!},3,{say Three exactly!}
* Luigi says,, "Less than three!"
teach @Switch 4=>3,{say Greater than three!},<3,{say Less than three!},3,{say Three
exactly!}
* Luigi types --> @Switch 4=>3,{say Greater than three!},<3,{say Less than
three!},3,{say Three exactly!}
* Luigi says,, "Greater than three!"
Kronus says, "Oh sweet..."
* Luigi says,, "The greater than and less than symbol can be used when dealing with
integers."
Rhayden nods. "Very useful."
Xeiran says, "Right."
* Luigi says,, "Another very useful feature of @Switch.."
* Luigi types --> @Switch 1=<3,{say Less than three!},{say #$}
* Luigi says,, "Less than three!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch 4=<3,{say Less than three!},{say #$}
* Luigi says,, "4"
* Luigi says,, "Behold #$."
* Luigi says,, "#$ might look funky, but let me explain."
Faizah says, "Oooh. That's new to me. *listens*"
* Luigi says,, "#$, when used inside of a @Switch or Switch(), is replaced with
whatever was switched on."
Rhayden says, "Sweet!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch BLAH BLARG BLAH BLAH=*,{say You tried to switch on #$.}
* Luigi says,, "You tried to switch on BLAH BLARG BLAH BLAH."
Kronus says, "Ahhhh thats useful..."
* Luigi says,, "You wildcards and the greater than and the #$ can be combined to
create powerful @Switch statements."
* Luigi types --> @Switch [rand(50000)]=*5*,{say The number had a 5 in
it!},<40000,{say The number was less than 40000.},{say The number was #$.}
* Luigi says,, "The number had a 5 in it!"
* Luigi says,, "The number was less than 40000."
* Luigi ponders for a second.
Kronus grins
* Luigi types --> @Switch [rand(50000)]=*5*,{say The number had a 5 in
it!},<40000,{say The number was less than 40000.},*,{say The number was #$.}
* Luigi says,, "The number was less than 40000."
* Luigi says,, "The number was 34321."
Rhayden says, "@switch/first"
Kronus says, "What did you do?"
* Luigi says,, "Alright, it appears the default isn't always run if it matches
something else first in the @Switch. So use a *."
* Luigi types --> @Switch test=hi,{say Nyah},{say Test}
* Luigi says,, "Test"
* Luigi types --> @Switch test=test,{say Nyah},{say Test}
* Luigi says,, "Nyah"
* Luigi types --> @Switch test=test,{say Nyah},*,{say Test}
* Luigi says,, "Nyah"
* Luigi says,, "Test"
Faizah says, "The number was less than 40000."
Faizah says, "The number was 3473."
* Luigi says,, "So if you ALWAYS want the default to run (in a @Switch, not a
@Switch/first), use a *."
Rhayden nods.
Faizah nods.
Rhayden says, "That's why my defaults only happen if nothing else happens."
Rhayden says, "Which is why I rarely use @swi/first"
* Luigi says,, "However, @Switch/First is what I usually use."
Faizah says, "The number was 648476."
Faizah says, "The number was less than 40000."
Faizah says, "The number was 27997."
Xeiran says, "Because the default is anything"
* Luigi says,, "Because, if you'll recall, it only matches the first thing it can
match, instead of all."
* Luigi says,, "Anyone confused?"
Rhayden nods.
Rhayden says, "Er, no. I'm good."
Faizah is fine.
Xeiran says, "I'm not."
* Luigi says,, "Good :)"
Kronus nods...
Xeiran says, "But Pollyanna's confused."
Kronus says, "Oh I'll get it... just give it time to sink in... . keep going..."
* Luigi says,, "The greater than and less than can be used for easy number checking.
Do this with your parrot:"
* Luigi types --> &enter_number parrot=$enter number *:@swi/first val(%0)=<1,{say
Please enter a number between 1 and 100.},>100,{say Please enter a number between 1 and
100.},{say Thank you! Your number was #$.}
* Luigi says,, "Place that on your parrot, drop it, and type: enter number <a number>"
RhayParrot has arrived.
Rhayden drops RhayParrot.
Kronus drops Dragon.
enter number 50
I can't see that here.
Rhayden says, "No worky"
* Luigi says,, "Oh, my mistake. "Enter" is a command."
* Luigi types --> &enter_number parrot=$enternumber *:@swi/first val(%0)=<1,{say Please
enter a number between 1 and 100.},>100,{say Please enter a number between 1 and
100.},{say Thank you! Your number was #$.}
Kronus nods
Fizzeth P'rot has arrived.
Faizah drops Fizzeth P'rot.
* Luigi says,, "Needs to be one word, or it gets confused with the game command ENTER."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
RhayParrot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
* Luigi types --> enternumber 50
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Thank you! Your number was 50."
* Luigi types --> enternumber dfhfdg
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Dragon says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Dragon says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Dragon says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
RhayParrot says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Thank you! Your number was 50."
Dragon says, "Thank you! Your number was 50."
RhayParrot says, "Thank you! Your number was 50."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Thank you! Your number was 8."
Dragon says, "Thank you! Your number was 8."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Thank you! Your number was 4."
Dragon says, "Thank you! Your number was 4."
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Thank you! Your number was 8."
Dragon says, "Thank you! Your number was 8."
Pollyanna has arrived.
Xeiran drops Pollyanna.
* Luigi says,, "So greater than and less than when used like this could great a Guess
The Number game, of sorts."
* Luigi says,, "Please pick up your pets once you are finished testing."
Kronus takes Dragon.
Fizzeth P'rot has left.
Faizah takes Fizzeth P'rot.
RhayParrot has left.
Rhayden takes RhayParrot.
Rhayden is reminded of SpamBot. :)
* Luigi heh.
Pollyanna says, "Thank you! Your number was 5."
* Luigi says,, "Last, there is a function form of @Switch. Switch()."
Pollyanna says, "Please enter a number between 1 and 100."
Pollyanna says, "Thank you! Your number was 48."
* Luigi says,, "It acts pretty much the same, only you cannot put @Commands inside of
it (or any function)."
Pollyanna says, "Thank you! Your number was 2."
Xeiran says, "Wait a second, what's val()?"
* Luigi says,, "It also defaults to "switch first"."
Kronus says, "Not even get()?"
Rhayden types --> help val()
* Luigi says,, "Oh yes, VAL() takes an argument, and turns it into an Integer."
* Luigi types --> say val(5)
* Luigi says,, "5"
* Luigi types --> say val(5gdfgfd)
* Luigi says,, "5"
* Luigi types --> say val(fhfdg)
* Luigi says,, "0"
Rhayden types --> say val(4.555)
Rhayden says, "4"
* Luigi says,, "I did that to make sure @Switch was dealing with integers."
* Luigi says,, "Now, a little work with Switch()."
Kronus says, "You mean you can't use get() in side the switch()"
* Luigi says,, "You can. Get() is a function.,"
Fizzeth P'rot has arrived.
Faizah drops Fizzeth P'rot.
Fizzeth P'rot says, "Ding Ding Ding! Your number was 37! You have won: An old sock!"
* Luigi says,, "I'll show some examples of what you can and can't do."
* Luigi types --> say switch(5,<3,Less than 3,Number was 3 or more. Number was #$.)
* Luigi says,, "Number was 3 or more. Number was 5."
* Luigi says,, "Much like @Switch, #$ and > and < work."
Fizzeth P'rot has left.
Faizah takes Fizzeth P'rot.
* Luigi types --> say switch(5,5,say Say is a command this will not work)
* Luigi says,, "say Say is a command this will not work"
* Luigi types --> say switch(5,5,@emit Hi)
* Luigi says,, "@emit Hi"
Kronus says, "Oh... ok"
* Luigi says,, "Switch() isn't used as often as @Switch. But you may find uses
sometimes."
Rhayden says, "If you want to switch on something inside another function?"
* Luigi says,, "Right."
* Luigi says,, "Any questions?"
Rhayden says, "Nein."
Kronus says, "I think I'll get it"
Faizah says, "Can't recall. Can you @fo object=switch(3,3,@emit three!,<3,say lower
than three,>3,pose thinks of a number higher than three.)"
* Luigi says,, "Yes, you can."
* Luigi says,, "Let us now discuss strmatch(). Strmatch takes two arguments, like so:
strmatch(<arg 1>,<arg 2>)"
* Luigi says,, "Basically, what it does is return a 1 if <arg 1> matches <arg 2>, or a
0 if not."
* Luigi says,, "It also allows for wild cards in <arg 2>. Example:"
* Luigi types --> @Switch strmatch(corndogs,*corn*)=1,{say Had corn in it!},{say Didn't
have corn in it.}
* Luigi says,, "Had corn in it!"
* Luigi types --> say strmatch(corndogs,*corn*)
* Luigi says,, "1"
* Luigi types --> say strmatch(buffalo wings,*corn*)
* Luigi says,, "0"
Xeiran raises his hand/.
* Luigi says,, "Yes, Xei?"
Xeiran says, "You could use it for a password."
Rhayden nod
* Luigi says,, "There is also a similar function, match(), which returns which word in
a list of words matched, or 0 if not."
* Luigi types --> say match(corn dogs,corn)
* Luigi says,, "1"
* Luigi types --> say match(corn dogs,dogs)
* Luigi says,, "2"
* Luigi types --> say match(corn dogs,dog*)
* Luigi says,, "2"
* Luigi types --> say match(corn dogs,corn*dogs)
* Luigi says,, "0"
Faizah types --> say match(corn dogs,*o*)
Faizah says, "1"
Xeiran says, "0"
* Luigi says,, "Each word is seperated by a space and you can only match one word with
match()."
* Luigi says,, "Let us see an example of how this can be useful:"
* Luigi types --> @Switch match(green red yellow,red)=0,{say Not a valid color!},1,{say
You picked [ansi(g,Green)]!},2,{say You picked [ansi(r,Red)]!},3,{say You picked
[ansi(y,Yellow)]!}
* Luigi says,, "You picked Red!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch match(green red yellow,green)=0,{say Not a valid
color!},1,{say You picked [ansi(g,Green)]!},2,{say You picked [ansi(r,Red)]!},3,{say
You picked [ansi(y,Yellow)]!}
* Luigi says,, "You picked Green!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch match(green red yellow,yellow)=0,{say Not a valid
color!},1,{say You picked [ansi(g,Green)]!},2,{say You picked [ansi(r,Red)]!},3,{say
You picked [ansi(y,Yellow)]!}
* Luigi says,, "You picked Yellow!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch match(green red yellow,FDHGDHF)=0,{say Not a valid
color!},1,{say You picked [ansi(g,Green)]!},2,{say You picked [ansi(r,Red)]!},3,{say
You picked [ansi(y,Yellow)]!}
* Luigi says,, "Not a valid color!"
* Luigi says,, "Ignore my first example. I made a typo."
Faizah says, "Ahhhh"
Faizah is glad I'm logging.. afk. Continue.
Xeiran says, "I think I get it"
* Luigi says,, "Now, match() may not seem incredibally useful right now. If not, don't
worry. In MUSHCoding 201 we will deal with it more in a more in depth manner."
* Luigi says,, "I want to discuss two more functions, and how they can be used
together."
Xeiran says, "Whatever is matched to the list of words returns the order of the word
matched?"
* Luigi says,, "Yes.."
* Luigi says,, "You all may recall rand(), which allows you to generate a random
number."
Xeiran nods.
* Luigi says,, "Now I want to show you how to generate a random word."
* Luigi says,, "Using first(), and shuffle()."
Xeiran says, "Fun fun"
* Luigi types --> say first(shuffle(A B C D E F))
* Luigi says,, "D"
* Luigi types --> say first(shuffle(A B C D E F))
* Luigi says,, "E"
* Luigi types --> say first(shuffle(A B C D E F))
* Luigi says,, "E"
Faizah says, "Back. Oooh."
* Luigi types --> say first(shuffle(A B C D E F))
* Luigi says,, "F"
* Luigi types --> say first(shuffle(A B C D E F))
* Luigi says,, "B"
* Luigi says,, "Shuffle takes a list of words, and shuffles them up."
Rhayden says, "Good ole first(shuffle())"
* Luigi types --> say shuffle(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z)
* Luigi says,, "r d w f p x c o q i m t n l b v a h y u k z j s e g"
* Luigi types --> say shuffle(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z)

* Luigi types --> say shuffle(how are you)
* Luigi says,, "you how are"
* Luigi types --> say shuffle(how are you)
* Luigi says,, "are you how"
* Luigi says,, "First() returns the first word in a list."
teach say first(YO YO MA)
* Luigi types --> say first(YO YO MA)
* Luigi says,, "YO"
* Luigi types --> say first(I am Luigi)
* Luigi says,, "I"
* Luigi says,, "Combined, you can get a random word."
Xeiran says, "You could make a more coherent word by putting a list of consanants, and
then vowels... you'd have a speakable word (maybe)"
* Luigi says,, "There are also some fun, similar functions."
* Luigi types --> say scramble(abcdefg)
* Luigi says,, "cdegabf"
* Luigi types --> say scramble(abcdefg)
* Luigi says,, "cfgdbae"
* Luigi types --> say scramble(abcdefg)
* Luigi says,, "cgbdaef"

of them."
Xeiran says, "f"
Xeiran says, "e"

Xeiran says, "k"
Faizah nods.
Xeiran says, "Hmm, strange random word"
* Luigi types --> @Switch first(shuffle(corn dogs))=corn,{say #$!},dog*,{say #$!}
* Luigi says,, "corn!"
* Luigi types --> @Switch first(shuffle(corn dogs))=corn,{say #$!},dog*,{say #$!}

* Luigi says,, "Alright. I want to thank you all for coming to my classes. I will be
handing out the final project, which will be the last critera for you passing this
class. Your GPA will be recorded in a global, and you will be able to take MUSHCoding
201 which I plan to begin in a week, or two."
Rhayden says, "yay!"
Faizah says, "Cool"
* Luigi says,, "I have decided to skip the final exam this term. There may be one in
MUSHCoding 201 though."

Rhayden says, "Ding"
* Luigi says,, "Here is the project requirements:"
* Luigi says,, "Create an object which demonstrates your ability to Say, @Listen,
@Switch, and Ansi()."
Suggestions:
* Answering Machine (records visitors to a room, greets them as they
arrive, allows them to leave messages only visible to the owner.)
* Dog or other pet (does tricks command. Use @Listen with a @Switch
in it, and not ^-patterns.)
* Luigi says,, "You can basically do anything, and may substitute Say with @Pemit or
@Emit."
Faizah says, "Cool"
