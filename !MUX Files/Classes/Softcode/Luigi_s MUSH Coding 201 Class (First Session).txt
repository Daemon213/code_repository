 CLASS: MUSHCoding 201
PART: 1
DATE: 12/07/2002 TIME: 6 PM
INSTRUCTOR: Luigi
DESCRIPTION: The first class of MUSHCoding 201 ever held. Most of it has
been left in its original state, though some parts of the log were edited
to remove spam or correct a speaker's typo. A '*' has been placed in front
of the speaker's name.

Luigi's Classroom
..is a pit. @Dolists and iter()'s float about, encapsulating each other, and surrounding and being surrounded by a plethora of other functions and @commands. It's a mess. Some of the code here is scribbled on walls and notebook paper, while even more of it is written on the windows with crayons or scratched into the floors. Madness. You wonder how you'll ever learn how to code now.

* Luigi says, "Let me begin by saying welcome to MUSHCoding 201. A few things to know for those of you who haven't taken 101:"
* Luigi says, "Rather, a few things you should know if you wish to understand this class. @Switch, @Listen, and @Ahear. If you understand these then you should be right where MUSHCoding 101 left off."
* Luigi says, "If not, mail me and I'll try to get another 101 class going soon if there's enough interest."
* Luigi says, "Today we are discussing a very important topic in MUSHCoding, Iteration."
Faizah settles in, listens.
* Luigi says, "What is Iteration? It is the doing of something in code a certain number of times. For those of you familiar with other programming languages, it is somewhat like a FOR loop. An example of simple iteration:"
* Luigi types --> @dolist 1 2 3=say ##
* Luigi says, "1"
* Luigi says, "2"
* Luigi says, "3"
Glassbrain has arrived.
Link shudders, loops.
Genvieve uses think, so as not to spam ;>
XML raises his hand.
* Luigi says, "There are two forms of Iteration, via functions and via commands. Right now we will discuss how to iterate commands with @DOLIST."
* Luigi says, "Yes XML?"
XML says, "What's the equivilent of a elsif in MUSHcode?"
Jade has arrived.
XML <--- Perl prog.
XML says, "elseif."
Jade waves.
Jade says, "Have I missed anything?"
* Luigi says, "@Switch would be the ELSE IF equivilant, xml."
Link says, "Only my mysteriousness."
XML nods.
* Luigi says, "We were discussing @Dolist Jade."
XML says, "Gotcha."
Jade says, "Ahh, ok."
* Luigi says, "See previous class's logs for info on how to use @Switch."
XML nods.
Jade whips out notebook, and listens in.
Jade says, "Ok."
XML says, "I will."
* Luigi says, "Now, @Dolist is used in the following way:"
Link says, "You should put them on the page, later Luigi."
* Luigi says, "@Dolist <list of words>={what to do with each word}"
Link says, "Select Case?"
* Luigi says, "Use {} like we did with @Switch so multiple commands work."
* Luigi says, "@Switch is also the SELECT CASE equivilant, Link."
* Luigi says, "@Switch does it all. Now, back to @Dolist.."
XML raises hands again (sorry, curious).
Link nods.
* Luigi says, "As you may have noticed, much like in @Switch, ## is replaced with the current word in the list, in a @Dolist."
* Luigi types --> @dolist corn dogs=say ##
* Luigi says, "corn"
* Luigi says, "dogs"
XML says, "Can you, for example, use "%0", and "%1" and the like with @dolist?"
* Luigi says, "Well, in switch it was #$ to show the thing switched on."
XML says, "Ah, okay."
"(xml's question answered in a bit) But let's try something."
* Luigi says, "Everybody find an object to code on. @Create it, or use one you already have."
Faizah nods
* Luigi says, "This might be what you meant XML, tell me after we do it."
Link says, "Ah, silence. no more annoying warnings in @wcheck."
Jade still has plenty warnings. :/
* Luigi types --> &addlist <that object>=$addlist * by *:@dolist %0=say add(##,%1)
Faizah says, "Speak for yourself. I asked for a lot to be appraised, and got 12 lines of spam in my log now."
Jade says, "Um."
Faizah says, "The appraisal object which I never saw.. *shrug*"
* Luigi says, "Set that attribute. Drop the object, test it, then pick it up."
XML drops Moof!.
Jade drops CodeFiesta.
CodeFiesta says, "9"
Moof! says, "9"
CodeFiesta says, "#-1 ARGUMENTS MUST BE NUMBERS"
Moof! says, "#-1 ARGUMENTS MUST BE NUMBERS"
Rhayden drops TestObject.
* Luigi says, "Try: addlist 1 2 3 by 10"
Hikenin drops Test Object.
Test Object says, "3"
TestObject says, "3"

Class Object says, "13"
Test Object says, "11"
Test Object says, "12"
Test Object says, "13"
(Much of this type of spam)
* Luigi says, "We're adding the %1 register to each item in the %0 register, via @Dolist. That what you meant, xml?"
Class Object says, "11"
Class Object says, "12"
Class Object says, "13"
(Much of this type of spam)
Faizah says, "11"

Class Object says, "13"
(Much of this type of spam)
Moof! says, "427"
* Luigi says, "No it's not, people are just typing it a bunch. Please pick up the objects now."
Genvieve takes Class Object.
XML takes Moof!.
Faizah takes FizBum.
XML says, "Quiet, moof, or I shall have to kill you."
Hikenin takes Test Object.
Faizah says, "Set it on myself by mistake. Oops."
Krang has arrived.
Jade takes CodeFiesta.
Tester says, "12"
Tester says, "13"
Tester says, "14"
Tester says, "15"
Tester says, "16"
Tester says, "20"
Krang gestures vaguely. "Did I miss anything?"
* Luigi says, "Other common uses for @Dolist include displaying large amounts of data, which wouldn't fit into one @Pemit. When used in combination with the LNUM() function, a @Dolist number list can be automated."
* Luigi types --> say lnum(1,10)
* Luigi says, "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
Jade says, "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
* Luigi types --> @dolist lnum(1,10)={say ##;say second command}

* Luigi says, "second command"
Jade says, "Ok. I get it."
* Luigi says, "Any questions before we move on?"
Rhayden mmmm, spammy
Link says, "OH DEAR LORD"
Jade says, "The 's help to group different....commands together?"
Faizah says, "no questions. But it's going to be fun editing this log."
Jade says, "{}"
Jade nods. and how.
* Luigi says, "Yes Jade. Just like in @Switch, it's a good idea always to use them."
Jade nods.
Link says, "Use lock them to yourself and use others in a think command."
XML says, "luigi, is that the 'teach' command"
* Luigi says, "Just get into the habit of using the {}'s. @Dolist <list>={<what to do with each item in list>}"
* Luigi says, "Yes XML, I am using teach."
XML says, "r"
XML says, "e"
XML says, "d"
Faizah says, "FizBum is locked to me."
Rhayden says, "faizah, @lock/use it to you"
Faizah says, "I did"
* Luigi says, "Next topic. Function iteration."
Faizah nods attentively.
* Luigi says, "Function iteration is very powerful. Like @Dolist, it does something a certain number of times. An example:"
Jade listens.
XML giggles.
* Luigi types --> say iter(1 2 3,##!)
* Luigi says, "1! 2! 3!"
Faizah says, "1! 2! 3!"
* Luigi types --> say iter(lnum(1,100),##)
* Luigi says, "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100"

Rhayden types --> say spellnum(2345243)
Rhayden says, "two million three hundred forty-five thousand two hundred forty-three"

XML says, "nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine"
Link smacks XML.
Jade says, "eighty-eight million three hundred eighty-three thousand three hundred eighty-nine"
* Luigi says, "Now, before we move on to some practical uses of Iteration, let us discuss Delimiters."
Rhayden says, "FAIZAH"
XML says, "six hundred sixty-six"
Rhayden says, "Why does everything you say give off garbled text?"
Link says, "she is using happy facy."
Link says, "she is using happy facey."
Rhayden grar
Faizah eeps. The happy facey thing. Sorry. Won't do it again.
XML says, "#! faizah! faizah#!"
XML says, "#! geez! geez#!"
XML says, "#! hehe! hehe#!"
* Luigi says, "A "list" in MUSHCode is a series of words, seperated by something known as a delimiter."
Link says, "Your client is inferior."
* Luigi types --> say iter(1 2 3,##)
* Luigi says, "1 2 3"
Faizah says, "eleven twenty-two thirty-three"
* Luigi says, "In this example, 1 2 3 is seperated by the ' ' (space) delimiter."
XML says, "11 33 44 55"
* Luigi types --> say iter(1|2|3,##,|)
* Luigi says, "1 2 3"
* Luigi says, "But in this example, '|' is the delimiter."
XML says, "1|2|3|4|5#!"
Rhayden says, "XML and Faizah, could you please "think" your examples to yourself?"
Rhayden says, "It's getting confusing."
XML says, "Okie."
Link says, "Go vb."
XML says, "Sorry."
* Luigi says, "Iter() takes an option 3rd argument, which is what the list given to it is seperated by (the delimiter)."
Faizah says, "OK"
* Luigi says, "Iter() also takes an option 4th argument, with what to delimit the list being outputted with."
* Luigi types --> say iter(1|2|3,##,|,|)
* Luigi says, "1|2|3"
* Luigi types --> say iter(1|2|3,##,|,*)
* Luigi says, "1*2*3"

* Luigi says, "'%r' is a register which means a new line return. We will talk about registers in another class."
* Luigi types --> say iter(1 2 3,##,,%r)
* Luigi says, "1
2
3"
* Luigi says, "In this example, I left the 3rd argument blank, to indicate the list given to it was delimited with spaces."
Link says, "frmCalc.Top = (Screen.Height - frmCalc.Height) / 2
frmCalc.Left = (Screen.Width - frmCalc.Width) / 2"
Link says, "oops"
* Luigi says, "This is the basis for most +who commands."
Rhayden nods.
Jade noddles.
Jade says, "So that's part of how it's done. :)"
* Luigi says, "I will show you how to make a very basic +who, after we discuss: DBREFS."
XML cheers wildly
Rhayden woo, dbrefs
Genvieve says, "Hrm."
Faizah says, "Whoo! Number thingies."
* Luigi says, "Yes, very exciting!@?!@!@ :)"
Link hmms.
Genvieve says, "I may need to wait for 301 ;)"
* Luigi says, "Every object in the game has a DBREF. It's simply a unique number used to reference it in code."
Krang says, "dbrefz r yay"
* Luigi types --> th num(me)
Link clutch triforce of power.
* Luigi says, "That is your DBREF. They come in the format #<number>. You may all know this but incase somebody doesn't there we go."
XML says, ":raises hand"
* Luigi says, "Yes XML?"
XML says, "How do you manipulate dbrefs for things you don't own?"
XML says, "dISPLAY THem, such as."
XML says, "Is there a special way?"
XML says, "Or is it just as if you were displaying something of your own's?"
* Luigi says, "Well, a lot of functions return DBREF, such as NUM()."
Faizah types --> th num(Faizah)
* Luigi types --> say num(xml)
* Luigi says, "#8364"
XML says, "Oh, okay."
* Luigi says, "Note, if you are trying to get the number of a player, using their name only works if they are in the same room. To get their name from afar, place a '*' in front of it."
* Luigi types --> say num(SPamBot)
* Luigi says, "#-1"
* Luigi types --> say num(*SPamBot)
* Luigi says, "#4014"
* Luigi says, "That is called the Global Operator, or some such thing."
* Luigi says, "Only works on player names, too."
XML nods.
Faizah drops FizBum.
Krang says, "An operator version of pmatch.. 'tis yay."
Faizah types --> say num(FizBum)
Faizah says, "#13059"
* Luigi says, "Now, another function that returns a DBREF, a list of them actually, is LCON(). This lists the contents of something."
* Luigi says, "Let me show you how iter() can be used in this situation.."
* Luigi types --> say lcon(here)
* Luigi says, "#13059 #10000 #8298 #10508 #7215 #9860 #6342 #8364 #3146 #4184 #1000 #12460 #535 #12696 #9548 #9633 #5710 #4216"

Link raise hand.
* Luigi says, "The NAME() function takes a single DBREF, and returns its name. We took the list, parsed it through ITER(), and changed the delimiter to %r."
* Luigi says, "Yes Link?"
XML hands Faizah a note
Link says, "I have an object that teleports the user to another location via a command, but since I don't own the other room that the other object is in, it won't let them travel back through. How do I remedy this?"
Rhayden says, "Use an exit instead of @teleport?"
* Luigi says, "It won't let you @tel them back, you mean?"
Link nods.
* Luigi says, "Perhaps you have them ENTER the object and use an @AENTER."
Link says, "an exit would mess up mine idea and make the rooms linkable."
Rhayden says, "Make the object into an exit, or make an exit in the object."
Link hmms
* Luigi says, "Onward, there are a lot of functions that deal with DBREF.."
* Luigi types --> say home(*Luigi)
* Luigi says, "#10"
* Luigi types --> say name(home(*Luigi))
* Luigi says, "AnsiCity Town Square"
Link has left.
Rhayden chuckles
* Luigi says, "Home() returns the home room of another player."
Faizah says, "#11384"
Faizah says, "Erp"
Rhayden says, "You didn't link yourself to your castle, Luigi?"
* Luigi says, "I have a $-command for that."
Rhayden ah
* Luigi says, "Another way to get a player's DBREF is through PMATCH(), as Krang hinted at."
* Luigi types --> say pmatch(Rhayden)
* Luigi says, "#12460"
* Luigi types --> say pmatch(Yoda)
* Luigi says, "#884"
* Luigi says, "PMATCH doesn't require the * operator, but basically everything else does."
Faizah says, "#-1"
* Luigi says, "Though it WILL take it, it's not necessary."
Rhayden says, "Is that the only advantage to pmatch() over num()/name()/etc?"
* Luigi says, "Rhayden, PMATCH() is useful for things like +FINGER. Where someone enters a player name into a register, and you want to find out what the DBREF of that is. That is why it doesn't need the *."
* Luigi says, "Now, the LWHO() function returns the list of DBREFS of everyone connected."
* Luigi says, "So, a simple +who is contructed.."
Rhayden ah
* Luigi types --> say iter(lwho(),##)

Rhayden says, "Much use of switch() and if(), I would imagine"

XML says, "Rhayden..."
XML says, "Remember to think your examples, please."
Rhayden says, "Blahblahblah"
Shadow-Link kackles.
* Luigi says, "As you can see, +WHOs and +WHEREs really aren't that impressive code-wise."
XML nods. Nope.
* Luigi says, "Naturally you can color them up with ANSI() and put other crap in it. For a list of functions that deal with DBREFS, see HELP DBREF FUNCTIONS. Moving onwards.."
* Luigi says, "Oh, about the +WHO. You'd also probably want to use an IDLE()."
* Luigi says, "Well, I guess I do have Time Functions on today's lesson."
XML plans on calling the command +graphwho
XML says, "graphwho, rather"
Shadow-Link kackles.
XML says, "no +"
* Luigi says, "Time functions basically revolve around time."
* Luigi types --> say time()
* Luigi says, "Sat Dec 07 19:01:01 2002"

Krang woo.
Shadow-Link says, "ctime"
* Luigi says, "Functions like TIMESTRING(), mentioned previously, deal in numbers. The number being "number of seconds"."
* Luigi says, "So how do you work with TIME() and CTIME() in such a case?"
* Luigi types --> say convtime(time())
* Luigi says, "1039312942"
* Luigi says, "Sat Dec 07 19:02:45 2002 was converted to the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970."
* Luigi says, "Which the MUSH can use in code, such as CONVSECS() which converts it back."

* Luigi says, "Every second the SECS() strong grows by one. One more second since Jan 1, 1970 has passed. So SECS() is a unique number for that second."
XML raise hand
* Luigi says, "You may or may not find use for TIME FUNCTIONS, see that help file for more functions dealing with them."
* Luigi says, "Yes XML?"
XML says, "Can you use secs as an identification for, say, a raffle?"
XML says, "And store it?"
* Luigi says, "You wouldn't want to, in case somebody bought more than one ticket in a second."
XML nods.
* Luigi says, "You could keep just a number in an attribute, and increase it every time someone bought a ticket."
* Luigi says, "I wish to discuss one more @command before I wrap up tonight's lesson."
Rhayden nods
Faizah listens.
* Luigi says, "Since we are talking about time, let's see a little thing called @Wait."
XML says, "How long until the lession is done (stuff to do)?"
* Luigi types --> @wait 5=say 5 seconds later
* Luigi says, "5 seconds later"
* Luigi says, "Use {} to group more than one command, like in @Switch and @Dolist."
* Luigi says, "It's almost over XML."
* Luigi types --> @wait 3={say hi;@wait 1={say hi}}
* Luigi says, "hi"
* Luigi says, "hi"
Shadow-Link says, "How do you setup the say iter thing with 3 columns?"
* Luigi says, "Let me give you the homework assignment for next class, so XML can go. And then I will tell you Link."
Rhayden nods.
Shadow-Link shrugs.
* Luigi says, "PROJECT 1: Personal +Who"
* Luigi says, "An object which allows you to 'addfriend <player>' and 'removefriend"
* Luigi says, "<player>'. <player> should accept player name or number, via pmatch()."
* Luigi says, "Then, by typing 'pwho' it will show to you a personal who, which"
* Luigi says, "shows you which of your friends are currently online, how idle they"
* Luigi says, "are, how long they have been connected, and what they have their"
* Luigi says, "@doing set to."
Shadow-Link plans evil thoughts.
XML says, "kay. bye"
* Luigi says, "To remove something (like a DBREF) from a list, check out REMOVE()."
* Luigi says, "Any questions can be mailed to eightbitmush@Hotmail.com."
* Luigi says, "Now, the 3-column who.."
* Luigi types --> say iter(1 2 3 4,##,%r)

2

4"

* Luigi says, "But let's say we removed the delimiter."
* Luigi types --> say iter(1 2 3 4,##,,)
* Luigi says, "1234"

Genvieve says, "What bout using table()?"
* Luigi says, "You can use table() too if you want. I don't like table, but you can use it. :)"
