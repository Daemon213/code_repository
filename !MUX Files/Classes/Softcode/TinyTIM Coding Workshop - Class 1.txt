 Thursday Nights, 10pm TDT, we're having a coding workshop at TIM University. The lecturer this time is Sketch the Cow, and the project is The Shuttle Bus To Take You To The Lecture Hall. Of course, having not built it, you have to walk there. Go to plane 18 (18), go North to the Quad (N), North to the Academic Buildings (N) and then to the Abe Vigoda Lecture Hall (ABE). All are welcome, many will enter, all will win. Skill Level: Beginning Coder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You hop a bus to TIM U., and jump off at the Campus Center.

TIM University - Campus Center

You're in the lobby of the Campus Center of TIM U., TinyTIM's official neo-liberal-arts-science-tech-business school. Around you pass by hundreds of zonked-out college students wearing baggy, underwashed clothing over their undernourished, underfed frames, babbling about inane things that they think matter, but in the grand scheme of things really don't. Across the back wall is a giant logo of the school's mascot, the "Fightin' Amish".

Through the quintuple glass doors north lies the main Quad of the campus, to the other buildings. The bus route back to the Nexus is south.

Obvious exits:

Student Store<SS> Nexus<out> Quad<N>

You push open the glass doors and stroll out onto the campus.

TIM University - the Quad

Across the pleasant green rectangle of the campus Quad stroll a number of alternately bookish and slacker-looking students. In the center of the Quad stands a large bronze statue of TIM gazing sternly off into the horizon. Rough path-like brown patches run across the ordinarily-green grass marking common student routes.

From here, the Academic Complex is north. The Administration tower leers off to the east, with the Campus Center south. The large foofball field lies to the east, while the dorm complex is southwest. Fraternity Row runs off to the northwest.

You found a penny!

You head east to the Admin building.

Admin Building

The Administration building is filled with middle-aged men and women who all live for their next cup of coffee. In the background you can hear the whirring of innumerous copiers all helping to add to the paper chase found at any University. The smell of toner and the sight of too many people wearing ties gives you little urge to venture beyond the outer lobby.

Obvious exits:

Lobby

Territan has arrived.

Territan sits down. With a bucket of popcorn.

Reo throws a pencil into the ceiling tiles.

Malady sits down, and promptly nods off.

Sketch ignores everyone talking about how much this class cost and how they intend to switch after the trial period.

JoeyLemur takes a frilled sandwich toothpick and a plastic straw, and shoots the toothpick into the tiles.

Br'fin slips pennies to bribe the TA

You say "Finding a parking spot was hell. I had to park way out by the stadium!"

Coal carves her name in the goofy little flip-up desk.

Territan says "I just took the bus that we're going to build tonight."

JoeyLemur says "Should've used the buses."

JoeyLemur dohs.

You say "That's what everyone says. But it's so *undignified!*"

Br'fin says "Stop time tripping Territan :)"

You say "Coal, no fair. You're dating the professor for your grade!"

Territan says "But it's so fun!"

JoeyLemur whips a rifle out of his overcoat, and shoots the apple on the lecturn. Apple bits go flying. JoeyLemur quietly puts the rifle back under his overcoat.

Malady snores and drools a bit on his fold-out desk.

Coal says "Nah, Reo. I'm MARRYING him for my grade. I'm dating him to find out the answers for the tests."

Malady holds up a sign (without waking up): HATE TO SEE WHAT SHE DOES FOR THE FINAL

JoeyLemur laughs.

Coal grins.

Malady puts the sign down, and snores.

Br'fin says "And Badger pipes up that that's what the Honeymoon is for""

JoeyLemur says "You know, I could have gone my life without the mental images that created."

Sketch likes those mental images, actually.

Malady waves to Badger, mumbles something about football practice, then falls asleep again.

JoeyLemur says "Well, you would."

You say "I can only imagine the sexiness of a cow making love to a piece of coal."

Sketch says "DAMNED Sexy, man."

Coal says "Woowoo."

Territan says "That's because you're a PARTICIPANT, Sketch. That might have something to do with it."

Sketch can't help who he is.

Br'fin snickers from his portable game system.

Elsinore has arrived.

Br'fin says "Heya sis"

Elsinore says "Anyone got a pen I could borrow? ;)"

Drool runs from Malady's desk top to the floor.

Sketch is going to wait 5 minutes after 10:00 because some people are into being fashionably late.

Farward has arrived.

Br'fin laughs "Of course, Elsi

Created: #37312

Br'fin slips a purple pen to Elsinore.

Locked.

Name set: Ballpoint pen

Set.

Natalie has arrived.

Natalie hugs around.

XA: @wait 500=:runs out of ink.

Sketch has connected.

Farward nods at everyone, just so he doesn't appear antisocial.

Given.

Triggered.

Sketch says "let's cover that right now."

Flag set.

Sketch says "This is not the Nexus. All rules are off."

Malady stirs...

Elsinore glances around and slips a note to the person next to her.

JoeyLemur says "BANAL CONVERSATION, AHOY!"

Sketch says "All suggestions, all stuff we've been going into for the whole week."

Ballpoint pen(#37312D) halted by being destroyed.

You get your 10 penny deposit back for Ballpoint pen.

Destroyed.

Dilettante has arrived.

Reo shrugs.

Dilettante Waves.

Coal makes random remarks about boring things you couldn't possibly know about or want to understand.

Elsinore says "Hiya Dil"

Dilettante says "Hello, Castle..."

Natalie excludes Coal!

Br'fin waves to Dilettante

JoeyLemur mutters about damnable Bostonians.

Reo just acts normally.

Elsinore makes a paper airplane and tosses it toward the front of the hall.

Malady yawns, then readies his pen and notebook.

Natalie says "Anyone mind being logged?"

Elsinore whistles.

Reo coughs pointedly and gives Elsi that "Honor student" look.

Sketch says "I don't care about context or hugs or whatever. The whole point is to improve the Nexus, not stop people from acting however they want in every room on the game."

Dilettante waves to Br'fin...

Sketch has encouraged logging.

Sketch is doubling up his

Sketch ...connection.

Natalie nods. I just got here, so I didn't know.

Malady says "Say it! Say it!"

sam has arrived.

Elsinore runs around hugging everybody!

Coal is logging.

Natalie gives Sketch an apple.

Elsinore hugs Sketch twice even.

Natalie neeners at the rest of you.

R'nice arrives in a flash of wizardly brilliance!

R'nice has arrived.

Coal hugs Elsi-poop-i-licious-i-snuggly-nore.

You say "Already been done, Nat. Now you're just a copycat!"

Elsinore giggles.

JoeyLemur says "Oh, SHIT. It's the DEAN!"

Territan shuts up. But you can page him with questions in case Sketch is busy.

Coal quietly retches after typing that.

Sketch says "And like I said, my problem with hugs was when it represents the only thing you do on TIM all day."

Natalie smirks.

Sketch says "That makes you like the fat guy in the diner who nurses the same cup of coffee for 8 hours."

Natalie gives Reo an.. apple.

Elsinore says "ew."

Natalie suppresses a giggle.

Sketch eats grass.

Reo eats it, worm and all.

Coal says "Careful Reo. Look where that led Adam."

R'nice says "My problem with hugs is when you forget to put down those two big cactuses your'e holding before you hug me."

You say "Cacti."

Reo slaps himself.

Sketch says "CACTUS HUGS" and runs towards R'nice.

Natalie holds three cacti and hugs R'nice.

Elsinore only has a toothy gator, but she puts it down to hug R'nice.

R'nice is the fat guy in the diner who doesn't drink coffee.

Elsinore laughs.

Sketch says "It's time for the old SAGGARRO SNUGGLE"

You say "Qapla'?"

JoeyLemur attaches hedgehogs to himself and then chases R'Nice.

Malady chuckles.

Elsinore says "Hey R'Nice did your Daily Show already go by? Did I miss it?"

R'nice says "You missed it."

Elsinore says "oh wait, i don't get the comedy channel anyway."

Coal is bringing her tape of it to the KhaOS BBQ tomorrow.

Elsinore says "oh cool."

Sketch shouts "Coding Workshop, starting within a minute or two. First and Final announcement."

Br'fin says "Neat"

Natalie hopes there's enough KhaOS to go around.

Br'fin says "Been watching Battlebots on Comedy Central myself"

Squeaky gets out her datapad

Sketch says "Most workshops don't have true beginners mixed up with rembrandt level coders. This will be interesting."

Malady whoops! "Battlebots!!"

Reo doesn't understand WHY battlebots is on CC now. On PBS/TLC was just fine.

R'nice is just auditing the course.

Territan says "I'm here primarily for support."

Coal has never seen Battlebots?

Squeaky says "My boyfriend is in those"

Sydney has arrived.

Jenn has arrived.

Coal says "Hey Jenn!"

Natalie sits next to R'nice and copies from his mind. :)

Jenn says "Hello!"

Coal saved Jenn a seat at the back with the cool kids.

R'nice is actually mostly watching Win Ben Stein's Money, but he'll want to read the transcript afterwords.

JoeyLemur enjoys Scrapheap Challenge / Junkyard Wars himself.

Jenn steals Natalie's notes.

You say "People build robots to compete/fight."

Elsinore wonders if Br'fin and R'Nice are the TA's.

Mara has arrived.

Reo nods at JL. That's very popular too.

Sketch heard R'nice was a hellish TA.

Natalie will photocopy 'em for you, Jenn!

Xarisa has arrived.

Empedocles has arrived.

Dilettante says "It's brand new, Coal... only ast 2 weeks"

R'nice says "Only hellish if you sucked. :)"

JoeyLemur says "Blonde British chick in shiny clothing... mmm..."

Sketch says "Woo, 2 minutes."

Br'fin says "Copying from me is it's own punishment, you'll be challenged to explain what it does :)"

Coal says "2 minutes to start?"

Dilettante says "I wish I had a video if when we did something like battlebots in HS... all I have is a few pics that I found online ofus"

You say "Kegger in the quad after lecture!"

Dilettante says "With flame throwers..."

Dilettante says "Of, not if"

Territan says "Kegger with flamethrowers? OOOOH!"

Farward says "My grasp of MUSH coding comes from a more recent variety of MUSH and doesn't quite mesh with what works well here. That's why I'm going to sit in on this session."

Dilettante says "No, Territan... we have flamethrower equipped robots :)"

JoeyLemur yells "CAN I GET A FOOF?"

Xarisa says "And there was much rejoicing. yay."

Territan says "yay -- damn, got it backwards again!"

You say "Aya. Surrender your mitochondria."

Malady jumps up in the air and yells "YAY!"

From JoeyLemur's overcoat, Programming Test Box Thingy attempts to laser "Yay!" into everyone's eyes simultaneously, causing a wicked light show.

Coal has the same problem, Farward.

Elsinore says "Take it outta the classroom, that's all I say!"

Malady is clueless and stupid as far as @HELP goes. That's why he's here.

Jenn says "Yay!"

Sydney yays.

Br'fin says "yay"

JoeyLemur yells "THAT'S THE TIM SPIRIT! GOOOO FIGHTIN' AMISH!"

Elsinore says "Um, er, yay!~"

sam says "Yay!"

Xarisa goes home.

Xarisa says, "Listen, I'd love to chat, but I've gotta climb a drainpipe right now. Why? Because I ran out of faery dust and I don't know how to fly." She repeats to herself, "Why?" and, giggling, climbs her own drainpipe.

Xarisa has left.

Farward gives Malady a clue. "It's just HELP, not @HELP." He winks.

Dilettante yells a late "yay".

Territan says "ATM at the Amish Market."

Sketch says "OKAY!"

Elsinore falls asleep now. zzz

JoeyLemur removes the dissected chicken from his workbench to make room for tonight's project.

R'nice wakes up. Commercial.

Sketch says "This is the first of these things, so not all the rules and the paradigms and other fun stuff is firmly established. Format and approach may completely change, and the lecturer/workshop leader will DEFINITELY rotate out."

sam remove his dissected pizza.

Sketch says "Already thinking about this whole thing, I do have a few ground rules though."

Br'fin nods

Sketch says "First of all, this is response to, but is not to be tainted with our little renaissance/revolution/complete destruction of TinyTIM that is going on out in the Nexus. Bring that in here, I bring you out of here."

Sketch says "Second of all, I'm uncomfortable with lecture. I'm going to show you how I would approach a problem, focusing on the easy, using basic code approach, not the full-bore-on Sketch approach, because that will kill you."

Sketch says "But I encourage you to build your own with you. You can feel free to build carrying the objects or to drop them and build them."

Br'fin snickers.

Sketch says "if you do drop them or build them, I want them examinable. I'll explain that in a moment."

Br'fin hides the spatula to scrape up folks after their brain explodes.

Elsinore pokes Br'fin. Shh!

R'nice raises his hand.

Sketch says "yes, R'nice?"

R'nice says "Are we allowed to heckle?"

Sketch says "Of course."

R'nice says "Thank you."

Farward says "Oh, good. I'd hate to see R'nice explode."

Sketch says "Few profs/leaders are in the position of discussing a subject next to the person who caused it."

R'nice smiles

JoeyLemur heckles. "Your mother was a carton of Ben and Jerry's!"

Natalie is, in that case, eating your mother. EW!

Natalie @ptuis.

Territan says "And your father smelled of Absolut Citron!"

Sketch says "Another thing, the companion to the mention I just had about the Nexus stuff, is that I WILL say that one of the basic things I was indicating in my letter is that there's NO such attention to subject matter/context/intelligent discourse in any other room in the game, so I'm not going to be sitting here making mention of context/grammar/flow. Etc."

Sketch says "I'm here to teach. Let me get on with that."

Elsinore says "here here"

Territan sits back and shuts up.

Coal says "Yeah, get on with it!"

Sketch says "I'm going to take advantage of TIM's ability to do pages and whispers. So we don't have to worry about people not admitting to understanding something in front of the group."

Sketch says "If you want to ask a question that you're embarassed to ask for some strange reason, you whisper it, and it'll spontaneously get answered while I'm doing stuff."

Sketch says "The first such question. Does everyone here understand the concept of the @create command?"

Malady does.

JoeyLemur says "Yup."

Kahlua has arrived.

Biff the Wonder Parrot has arrived.

Sketch says "Just page me no if you don't."

Jenn says "Mostly."

Squeaky nods

Natalie nods.

sam nods.

Kahlua says "biff, go away"

Biff the Wonder Parrot says "Okay, seeya."

You say "Should we answer in the affirmative, or just keep quiet unless we don't?"

Biff the Wonder Parrot has left.

Kahlua says "Please excuse my lateness."

Sketch says "I'd prefer you keep quiet unless you don't."

Sketch makes everyone point at Kahlua and @nelsonlaugh his lame late ass.

Reo points at Kahlua and does the Nelson Laugh, "Ha-Ha!"

Coal points at Kahlua and does the Nelson Laugh, "Ha-Ha!"

Kahlua hangs his head. "Hey, that really hurts..."

Sketch says "OK, we all have the create command. Do you understand the concept of flags as they apply to programming?"

JoeyLemur points at Kahula, and burps.

Malady doesn't.

Territan points at Kahlua and tries to do the Nelson Laugh, but his finger falls off. "Ow."

Squeaky is not quite sure. Has only found some flags

JoeyLemur doesn't have a clear idea.

Natalie could use further explanation of flags.

Sketch says "And finally, who here has never done coding on TIM beyond the setting of your attributes?"

Mara raises her hnand

Elsinore has done very minimal.

Malady raises a tentacle.

Br'fin raises several hands.

JoeyLemur has attempted to code... really...

Sketch sets Br'fin on fire.

Jenn raises her hand

Natalie hasn't done much.

Br'fin gets confused by grammar

Empedocles raises some of Br'fin's hands.

Coal has done some but not particularly successfully. Does that count?

RedEVIL has arrived.

Sketch says "Someone mentioned how the location of this lecture was in a somewhat odd place. As a result, tonight's project is a basic vehicle."

Sketch says "I'm building The TinyTIM Short Bus."

Sketch says "I rate this at the level of Beginner."

Sketch says "For the benefit of the more advanced coders in the audience, I am building the version that simply uses the inventory of the object to hold people."

Sketch says "And for those of you new to this, we are building a version of vehicles that are simple and functional, but of course there are much more advanced ways to build vehicles that can be covered in other lecturers or outside this workshop."

Biff the Wonder Parrot has arrived.

rainy has arrived.

Biff the Wonder Parrot perches happily on Elsinore's shoulder.

JoeyLemur gets out a parrot rifle...

Sketch says "Suffice to say, that like all basically interesting ideas in TIM code, you can go absolutely bugfuck on adding features."

Sketch says "Also, I will apologize ahead of time for my occasional pauses as I answer questions in whispers or generally have net weirdness."

Biff the Wonder Parrot goes home.

Biff the Wonder Parrot has left.

Territan says "'Bugfuck' will be covered in a later class, I hope. My technique only runs up as far as 'apeshit.'"

Sketch says "In TIM, there are 5 types of objects. Players, Things, Exits, Rooms, and generally garbage. But that's kind of a "sometimes y" situation, because you never really come into contact with garbage."

Sketch says "In the usual TIM way, you generally do programming on Things."

Sketch says "Programming can exist on Rooms and exits, but we're going to be building a thing."

Sketch says "it's generally good to have a clear idea of what you want to add to TIM, and whether it's worth building."

Sketch says "Here, I see a need to have a neat object that takes people to the Lecture hall because that sign won't always be out there."

Sketch says "So I think about what I want it to be; I want it to be fun, I want it to do what it says, and I want it to be somewhat flexible."

Sketch says "So hence the name, The TinyTIM Short Bus."

Sketch says "I create an object, like this: @create The TinyTIM Short Bus"

Sketch says "if you make one, name it something different."

Territan says "Or for the politically correct in the class, the TinyTIM Horizontally Challenged Bus."

JoeyLemur dropped PCIBus.

Sketch dropped The TinyTIM Short Bus.

R'nice says "I suggest you put your name on the object name."

R'nice says "That way we can easily see whose is shose"

Sketch says "R'nice has a good idea there."

Natalie dropped Natalie's Boots.

Sketch says "The @create command pulls out a garbage object from the database and declares it a thing, and makes you the owner, and puts it in your inventory with the name you gave it."

Coal dropped Coal's Bus Of DOOM!.

Sydney dropped SydneyvaD lupwI'.

Squeaky says "Ack too late"

Elsinore dropped Elsinore's Carry-a-Castle.

Kahlua dropped Kahlua's Moving Roadblock.

Sketch says "This costs you some pennies, but pennies are cheap and we reward builders."

Farward dropped lupDuj / Farward's Shuttlecraft.

Created: #69756

I don't know which one you mean!

Flag set.

Squeaky dropped Squeaky's TinyTMI longbus..

You don't have that!

Dropped.

Jenn dropped Jenn's Bus to Hell.

Abe Vigoda Memorial Lecture Hall

The campus' main lecture hall is wide and spacious, with rows of uncomfortable seats inclining downward towards the wooden podium. Whiteboards, covered with indecipherable scribbles, line the back wall, and a globe (globe?) of TIM rests to the podium's right. Pieces of paper and empty drink cups litter the floor beneath the seats.

Sketch says "A quick aside about pennies. The economy here has gone completely nuts. We most work off pride and self-reliance here. We give pennies freely to coders who sue them."

Territan dropped Territan's Micro-Bus.

Sketch says "Use, ahem."

JoeyLemur sues his wallet.

Farward sues Sketch for 50 pennies.

RedEVIL dropped RedEVIL's dislocated subway car.

Coal says "Or just to cute girls."

I don't know which one you want to lock!

JoeyLemur says "TIM had an economy?"

Natalie checks Coal's pocketbook.

Sketch says "We're going to skip ahead to a small but important thing about making it so others can see your work."

sam dropped The Sam Heap of Rusted Bus.

Elsinore grins @ Coal.

Name set: Reo's Doubledecker Bus

You see nothing special.

sam says "X_OK?"

Sketch says "You can set flags on yourself or something you own to change how the thing or you behave."

Sketch says "yes, X_OK."

I can't help you with that.

Sketch says "There are flags that handle how your object will function, or, for example, whether you can recieve pages."

I don't recognize that flag.

Sketch says "We won't go too much into flags here except to mention two: XAMINE_OK and ENTER_OK."

Elsinore is failing already. No wonder. She spell examine with an E.

Sketch says "As you might remember from your newbie days when you were told to just type "@LOCK ME = #0" and be done with it, I'll ask you to type @SET YourObject=XAMINE_OK"

Sketch says "Well, Elsinore, there's a reason for that."

Elsinore says "what's that?"

Coal recommends not trying to type '@set bus=Xamine_OK'. There are too many buses here!

Sketch says "The "E" flag name was already taken with some other, previously created types of flags."

Elsinore ahs.

Sketch says "When we needed the ability to make something examinable, we had X open, so we used that."

Elsinore says "makes sense."

JoeyLemur says "The X(amine) Files. Ooo wee oooo...""

Sketch says "There's a number of examples like that."

Sketch says "Now, the reason you all did that is so that you call could EXAMINE each others' work."

Location: Abe Vigoda Memorial Lecture Hall

Sketch says "If you type LOOK, you can choose among the buses and type EXAMINE <Name of Bus> and you'll see the "innards" of that bus."

Sketch says "Does everyone understand the EXAMINE command?"

Squeaky nods

Sketch says "OK, then. So the EXAMINE command shows you the "programming" side of something on TIM, separate from what people usually see when they interact with this stuff. You can ALWAYS examine your own stuff."

Sketch says "Let's set a second flag: ENTER_OK. @SET <Your Bus> = ENTER_OK."

Sketch says "We all understand I have the habit of putting something you fill in the blank for in <>'s, right? you don't type those."

Sketch says "Most of you caught all that at the welcome screen, so I figured."

Flag set.

Sketch says "OK, what you just did is make it so anyone can ENTER your bus."

Sketch says "Normally, only you can enter your own bus."

Natalie raises her hand.

Sketch says "yes?"

Malady dropped Malady's Rocket.

Natalie says "How would @locking the bus affect enter_ok?"

Elsinore gives Natalie the bathroom pass.

Natalie says "Or effect it. Whichever."

Sketch says "It doesn't affect it."

Natalie nods. Okay.

Sketch says "But there are ways to affect it, using an ENTER LOCK."

Elsinore locks the bathroom.

Territan says "The regular lock on the bus means people can't pick it up and walk off with it."

Sketch says "But that's out of the scope of this class. Locks are going to be awhole different thing."

Natalie says "Is that covered next semester?"

Sketch says "Right."

Natalie :)

Natalie nods. Got it. Thanks.

Coolman has arrived.

Sketch says "For now, we're making buses that are amazingly insecure and can be manipulated in many ways. That will explain in later classes why we added such unusual variations to the commands."

Coolman waves.

Mara says "Is there any way to look at an object to see what code you've already put to it?"

Br'fin giggles

Sketch says "Yes, you type EXAMINE OBJECT."

Coolman frowns at missing the coding lecture

You say "Mara... just fyi, The only coding we've done so far are flags, which show up as letters next to the object's name."

Kahlua says "You haven't missed much. :)"

Mara says "ahh... right, thanks Reo"

Coolman sits in a desk, and wonders what he missed.

JoeyLemur says "Transcripts will be made available."

Mara whispers "that's what the 'Xe' is after the numbers?"

Sketch says "OK, just so our little buses matter to us, let's flesh them out. Set the Description and Senses of these buses. Does everyone understand how you do that?"

Sketch says "This is the "Workshop" portion. :)"

Mara says "Nope\"

Sketch says "OK. Let's focus just on the description and senses of the buses."

Sketch says "Are you aware how to set a description?"

I don't know which one you mean!

Set.

I don't see that here.

I don't see that here.

You see nothing special.

Coolman dropped Coolman's Red ShuttleBus.

Huh? (Type "help" for help.)

Set.

You say "Sketch?"

You say "Whoops, nevermind."

Sketch says "Yes?"

Sydney wonders what a bus smells like.

You say "I think I'm skipping ahead, so I'll just wait."

Sydney :)

Coal says "Smells like teen spirit!"

You say "Hell, I'll ask now. What is the command for setting a smell again? @smell doesn't do it."

Elsinore sets the taste of her bus.

Coal says "@scent."

Set.

JoeyLemur :licks the PCIBus. Freak.

Sketch says "OK, some people can set the description (@DESC BUS = <Description>) but are missing the senses."

Natalie says "HELP SENSES"

Natalie says "Ooops."

Set.

TinyTIM Help Topic:

CONCEPT: THE SENSES ON TINYTIM

Most all TinyGames have the convention of being able to LOOK, and to LOOK

at stuff that's in the same Location. And like these other Tinygames, TIM

lets you set the "Description" of Rooms, Players, Exits and Object with the

@DESC Command. This lets you create the text that is displayed when you

LOOK at that Thing.

Well, TinyTIM has gone a step farther than that, and we now have ALL FIVE

Senses active on the game. This means that in addition to being able to

LOOK at everything, it is also theoretically possible to SMELL, TASTE,

LISTEN, and TOUCH everything as well. For instance, in the Nexus, you can

say TASTE OLD MAN, or TOUCH CLOCK, and you'll get an interesting response.

Here are the commands you should know to be able to use Senses properly on

TIM. Simply type HELP <TOPIC> for information on that command.

LOOK TASTE TOUCH SMELL LISTEN

@DESC @TASTE @TOUCH @SCENT @SOUND

@ATOUCH @OTOUCH @ATASTE @OTASTE

Use your senses!

Sketch says "HELP SENSES work, but I'll also mention the commands. @scent for smell, @sound for the sound, @taste for the taste, and @touch for the feel of it."

Jenn's Bus to Hell grows ears and can now hear.

Malady's Rocket grows ears and can now hear.

Sketch says "In each case, you want to build an object such that all the different senses combine to really flesh out the object."

Set.

Sketch says "Some people are typing @LISTEN instead of @SOUND. I do that all the time."

Territan says "Get creative with them, folks."

The Micro-Bus has the Travis Turntables logo on it, much like everything else about the MicroBrewery (hence the name). And much like everything else around the MicroBrewery, someone did a slapdash job of painting over it, using the oversized T---T-- to spell 'TinyTIM.' Naturally, this bus runs on alcohol. And so does its driver.

Sketch says "@LISTEN is a separate command that does a whole other set of things. To remove it, type @LISTEN"

Sketch says "Sorry, type @LISTEN <BUS> = and then nothing."

Malady's Rocket loses its ears and becomes deaf.

Mara says "Silly question, we've set them so they can be entered, does that mean that we should have two sets of senses for it?"

JoeyLemur licks the PCIBus. Freak.

Sketch says "We'll cover that a different time."

Malady says "Thanks, Sketch."

Sketch says "That'll be the best part, Mara."

Jenn says "Sketch, can you rename an object the same way you can rename your character?"

JoeyLemur runs his/her hand/tentacle/whatever across the PCIBus.

Elsinore ews.

Sketch says "You rename an object by typing @NAME OBJECT = <New Name>"

Coal says "Should we be setting @otouch, etc?"

Set.

Coal says "Or am I jumping ahead?"

You feel clammy cool stone, gritty with dirt and old moss.

Elsinore laughs at Reo, sending an earthquake through the room.

Elsinore grins.

You feel nothing special.

Sketch says "I'd say jumping ahead, but I will get to taht."

You run a finger across it. Oh look, it's dirty.

You taste nothing special.

Set.

Good thinking.

It's running quite smoothly and quietly.

Don't try and TOUCH a moving vehicle! You'll get your hand torn off!

Diesel... actually makes you kind of lightheaded.

One of those that you often see in London in the media. Go watch Spice World. However, this one actually comes out of Denver, Colorado.

Jenn's Party Bus to Hell loses its ears and becomes deaf.

"The crackling of fire, screams of torment, and a loud party all at the same time.

Sketch says "If you need to, steal other people's ideas."

Warm metal, as if heated from within.

Obvious exits:

Lobby

You see a big old fashion Shuttle Bus. It is kind of like the ones you see in old movies.

Something large and black blots out the ambient light ahead of you. Little lights dance up and down vertically, on what appears to be the corners of a large rectangular object.

Doq Dujvam 'ej Hurgh 'ej boch. 'Iwmo' yIQbogh 'etlh rur. / It's a shiny dark red. Like a blood-stained sword.

R'nice says "May I suggest that if you know how to do something, like otouches or whatever, don't ask, just do it. Nobody is gonna take points off for doing extra stuff."

Sketch says "See, the whole thing about building an object on TIM is it's your big opportunity to be really creative about adding yourself into them. It comes back in rewards, because people aren't afraid to use senses other than looking to learn about your objects."

Territan tastes My Last Pony. For the 14th time.

Sketch will cover extra stuff, but yes, I'm not here to keep you from going nuts if nuts is what you want.

One of those that you often see in London in the media. Go watch Spice World. However, this one actually comes out of Denver, Colorado.

Elsinore likes to set senses on mail she gives people.

Sketch says "Additionally, the more detail you put into an object, the more people visualize what you want them to."

Territan hms. "Touch, taste, scent, sound, @desc... I'm set. (Sorry!)"

Territan The TMI longbus seems to get longer as Territan strokes it.

The Micro-Bus has the Travis Turntables logo on it, much like everything else about the MicroBrewery (hence the name). And much like everything else around the MicroBrewery, someone did a slapdash job of painting over it, using the oversized T---T-- to spell 'TinyTIM.' Naturally, this bus runs on alcohol. And so does its driver.

I don't see that here.

Here is a bus that is long and narrow from the back to almost the front. The driver's part is bigger, though and sort of a rounded conical shape. The exterior of the bus is painted a sort of dark peach-pink that gets darker towards the front The front is a deeper reddish pink.

Squeaky says "Hrm.."

JoeyLemur The TMI longbus seems to get longer as JoeyLemur strokes it.

Home: Limbo(#0RSDlLHA)

Sketch says "I think, just to be completists, and because I think we're going to keep these here as showcases, you should type the following: @LOCK <Your Bus> = #0."

You say "Squeaky... might I congratulate you on making me uncomfortable with your bus. :)"

JoeyLemur says "Territan, you're disturbed."

JoeyLemur says "Er, Squeaky even."

Territan says "Nope, Joey... the TinyTMI bus is Squeaky..."

Squeaky says "Thanks, but I have to tighten up the code..it's a bit off"

Locked.

JoeyLemur says "You're disturbed, too."

You say "Wha does locking it o #0 do?"

Territan says "Thanks! Have you touched MY bus?"

Natalie says "#0?"

JoeyLemur runs a finger across the Micro-Bus and inspects it critically. His finger, that is ...not the bus.

Coal says "No one passes it then, I think."

You say "to. As opposed to locking it to 'me'?"

sam says "Limbo, right?"

Elsinore feels up Coal's Bus of DOOM! and is fortunate not to lose a hand.

Dilettante dropped Horse of Burden.

sam tastes Coal's Bus of DOOM! So weird.

Sketch says "OK, locking is where you're protecting certain uses of your object without your permission."

Squeaky :strokes the TMI bus. The TMI longbus seems to get longer as Squeaky strokes it.

Territan is NOT tasting the TMI bus.

Sydney says "What senses have 'other' thingys on them?"

Elsinore giggles.

JoeyLemur says "Drop the : in the otouch and otaste."

Set.

Sketch says "#0 is a room, Limbo. By typing @LOCK <BUS> = #0, you're saying 'The Only Thing that can pick up this bus is Limbo"."

Kahlua reaches out to touch Kahlua's Bus, which screeches to a halt, causing a EAT ME car accident.

Coal tastes Coal's Bus of DOOM! So weird.

Sketch says "Apparently we're going to have to go to Osenses. :)"

Territan says "And Limbo isn't greedy."

Set.

Kahlua says "Whoops"

Sketch says "Who here is new to the idea of the Osenses?"

Coolman can't type this fast!!

Coolman is new.

Mara says "new"

Malady is new. Humor him.

JoeyLemur considers licking JoeyLemur, but then thinks better of it.

Natalie has difficulty remembering the difference between Osenses and Asenses.

Set.

Sketch says "it's OK, Coolman. We're still working on fleshing out our buses, especially, apparently, our Flesh Buses."

Territan says "O=Other, A=Action."

One of those that you often see in London in the media. Go watch Spice World. However, this one actually comes out of Denver, Colorado.

Territan says "That's the mnemonic I use, anyway."

Kahlua reaches out to touch Kahlua's Bus, which screeches to a halt, causing a pick(2,3,4) car accident.

Elsinore always has to look at her exits to remember.

Natalie hugs Territan for the mnemonic!

Kahlua says "I give up :)"

Elsinore says "That's good Terr. thanks."

Coolman says "Ok, I'm still setting the @taste, and @touch"

Sketch says "Yes, besides the senses we have set (@DESC, @SCENT, @TASTE, etc.), some of these senses have companion settings."

Kahlua says "Why can I never remember how to make PICK work."

set: One of those that you often see in London in the media. Go watch Spice World.

Sketch says "R'nice made a decision some time ago that some senses are passive, and some are active."

JoeyLemur clonks Kahlua over the head with PCIBus. Too far ahead, lad.

Sketch says "LOOKing, LISTENing, and SMELLing were considered passive, that is, you could do them without drawing attention to yourself or others."

Sketch says "TOUCHing and TASTEing, however, were you doing something to someone."

JoeyLemur runs his/her hand/tentacle/whatever across the PCIBus.

JoeyLemur's PCIBus rubs up against JoeyLemur and coos.

Sketch says "So we created two commands, @OTASTE and @OTOUCH."

Set.

This is the doubledecker bus of fluffiness. Its cuteness is foretold by the baby blue plush exterior and Nerf seats.

Name set: Reo's Double-decker bus of fluffiness

Kahlua says "Thanks Joey, I know how this works"

Squeaky :licks the TMI longbus and immediately regrets it.

Elsinore says "Is it just those two senses or do they all have o and a?"

Sydney reaches out toward Sydney's jitney, which plows right over her. Pancakesville.

Sketch says "That's what you're seeing Joey's bus have. When he touches it, it will take his name (the TOUCHer), and prepend it before the contents of the @OTOUCH attribute."

Sketch says "Only TOUCHing and TASTEing do."

JoeyLemur licks the PCIBus. Freak.

Elsinore nods.

Coal says "Do the other senses have the a attributes?"

Jenn says "How do you make it know whether the person touching it is a him or a her?"

Sketch says "@OTASTE Short bus = takes this special moment during the third reel to suck on the Short Bus."

Sydney says "Does my @otouch do the right pronoun? I canna see it."

Set.

Natalie laughs. Pancakesville. :)

This bus just bursts with squishy, squoogy feelings. Your first inkling of the depth of its cuteness is foretold by the baby blue plush exterior and Nerf bumper.

Sketch says "Oh, yes, pronouns."

Sydney bows.

Set.

Sketch says "This was one of the first things in MUD. Pronoun substitutions."

Sketch says "I can't think of an easy way to describe it, but they're %p, %o, %s."

Coal says "Possessive, Objective and Subjective."

Natalie says "Possessive, objective, and subjective?"

Natalie nods to Coal.

Sketch says "Everyone say or think this: %p %o %s."

Farward says "possession (his, hers, its), object (him, her, it) and subject (he, she, it)."

Huh? (Type "help" for help.)

Set.

You say "say his him he"

Kahlua yanks his hand away. Ouch! This bus is hot!

Farward says "his him he"

You say "Reo Reo"

JoeyLemur runs his hand/tentacle/whatever across the PCIBus.

JoeyLemur's PCIBus rubs up against JoeyLemur's hand and coos.

Sydney says "If you capitalize the pronoun thingy, TIM will capitalize the pronoun when it comes out."

Squeaky licks the TMI longbus and immediately regrets it.

Squeaky's TinyTMI longbus. begins leaking a thick white fluid out of the radiator grille..ech!

Territan says "What Coal said."

Sketch says "What you're seeing is a reaction to whatever your SEX attribute is."

Elsinore blushes.

Damien has arrived.

Damien waves.

You say "I can't wait to ride the longbus."

Sketch says "Hi, Damien. Want to buy a bus?"

This bus just bursts with squishy, squoogy feelings. Your first inkling of the depth of its cuteness is foretold by the baby blue plush exterior and Nerf bumper.

Sketch says "ATASTE will define THE ACTION THE BUS WILL TAKE WHEN YOU OR SOMEONE TASTES IT."

set: This bus just bursts with squishy, squoogy feelings. Your first inkling of the depth of its cuteness is foretold by the baby blue plushy exterior and Nerf bumper. All along the sides are pictures of Care Bears, Rainbow Brites, Strawberry Shortcakes, Shirt Tales, Monchhichis, Paw-Paw Bears, etc. You squeal at the mere sight of it!

Coolman feels especially touchy-feely today, and leans up against Coolman's Red Shuttlebus.

JoeyLemur runs his hand/tentacle/whatever across the PCIBus.

JoeyLemur's PCIBus rubs up against JoeyLemur's hand and coos.

sam says "Does everybody see it?"

Kahlua leans over and licks the Party bus. He pulls back quickly with a horrified look on his face. Eeeew, road dirt.

Sketch says "However, this action is as if the bus is doing the action, and it has to be a real command, like :waves."

You say "Aha."

Kahlua pages: Taste my bus!

Coal says "How are %p, etc. evaluated in ATASTE and ATOUCH?"

Set.

Sketch says "It's therefore easy to mix @ATASTE and @OTASTE, for example, and give @OTASTE a :. It's a common mistake."

Territan says "Which is why the A-attributes need colons and things, and the O-attributes don't."

Sketch says "They are evaluated normally."

Set.

Coal says "But on which object. The person tasting, or the bus?"

Set.

Sketch says "The motivator. The person tasting."

Kahlua reaches out to touch the Party bus and quickly yanks his hand away. Ouch! This bus is hot!

Jenn's Party Bus to Hell morphs and looks as if it's growing a hand to try and keep Kahlua attached to it.

Squeaky licks the TMI longbus and immediately regrets it.

Kahlua pages: Come on, taste it!

If you're close enough to taste it, it means you weren't paying attention, and just ran into it. Smooth move.

Kahlua's Moving Roadblock vibrates a little more quickly under the pressure of Reo's tongue bath

R'nice says "Of course, it can be *any* command, not just :. You could have it "say" or "yell" or anything you like."

Kahlua says "Oh YUCK Squeaky! :)"

It tastes like a penis..That's what you get for licking it.

Squeaky's TinyTMI longbus. begins leaking a thick white fluid out of the radiator grille..ech!

Dilettante's Horse of Burden stares at Dilettante with firey eyes.

Malady fondles Natalie's boots, revelling in the texture of rich Corinthian leather.

Elsinore reaches out to touch Kahlua's Bus, which screeches to a halt, causing a 17-car pileup.

Kahlua's Moving Roadblock slows down to allow more folks to lay hands on its sides.

Malady runs an appendage along the smooth rocket. And cuts it self on a fin. That looks painful.

Malady's Rocket opens up a hatch and sends out a robot arm to wipe up the fingerprints and blood.

It's a curious smell of diesel gasoline and the RAGE of all the folks trapped behind it.

Elsinore places her hand against the hull of Farward's Shuttlecraft. She stands, mesmerized for a moment, then reluctantly breaks the connection.

Sydney licks the grey jitney. Why, I have no idea.

Sydney's jitney downshifts and shoots out an especially acrid cloud of exhaust, leaving Sydney choking in its wake.

Sketch says "looks good, Coolman."

Elsinore's Trojan Alligator takes a bite at Kahlua.

Squeaky has arrived.

Kahlua feels up Elsinore's Trojan Alligator and grins sheepishly.

Elsinore's Trojan Alligator chuckles and grins at Kahlua toothily. "Touch me again and I'll invite you for dinner."

Territan says "Or rather, %oself instead of %o self."

Coolman says "Ok, I need to put more detail into it, but it is too late to think :)"

Sketch says "OK, we have some damned fine buses."

Kahlua says "Hisself. :)"

Sketch says "It was pointed out to me that besides %o and %p and %s, there's %N."

sam Runs his's body along the rusty heap of sam's bus, grooving to it's finky curves.

The Sam Heap of Rusted Bus gets another rusted chunk taken out by sam.

Sketch says "Basically, %n will give the person's name. %N will capitalize it."

Coolman says "Coolman=Ok"

Coolman says "OOps :)"

Sketch says "These substitutions are mentioned in... HELP SUBSTITUTIONS."

R'nice says "I don't think so."

Elsinore pats Coolman. Yes you are.

Coal says "No, both give the name how it is."

You say "Reo Reo"

R'nice heckles over %N

You say "That's because your name is capitalized. It doesn't UNcapitalize it."

Mara dropped MaraBus.

R'nice says "Here, I *think* is the true poop on %N"

You say "At least, I think."

Jenn says "Coal, how'd you do that?"

Kahlua says "hee hee"

Squeaky points, "@idesced!!"

Coal says "@force."

Sketch says "They are: IDESC, ISCENT, ITASTE, ITOUCH, ISOUND."

Kahlua's Moving Roadblock runs a finger across the Micro-Bus and inspects it critically. Its finger, that is ...not the bus.

JoeyLemur's PCIBus tries to make a SketchBurger. Sketch politely moves out of the way.

Coal is being an obnoxious show-off. :P

Sketch will go into @force soon.

Kahlua is helping.

Coal hi-5s Kahlua.

I don't see that here.

Kahlua hi5's back. :)

This is the TinyTIM Short Bus, which takes its passengers to various TinyTIM-related Lectures at TIM University. Just type ENTER SHORT BUS, and in a short time you'll be taken off to class! The Bus is a bright, sickly orange-yellow and has black lettering on the side which says "SPECIAL TIM EDUCATION". Oh, you're cruising in style now.

Sketch says "So, if we go INSIDE our buses and type LOOK, we just see the name."

Mmm, exhaust! Better move to the front. Mmm, exhaust! (Must be a leak).

Coal says "@force is for people without friends."

JoeyLemur's PCIBus runs its hand/tentacle/whatever across the PCIBus.

TinyTIM Help Topic:

@COMMAND: @ENTER

@ENTER <Thing> = <Message>

@ENTER sets your ENTER attribute, which only has meaning on Rooms, Players,

and Objects. Exits can go suck on a popsicle, because the ENTER Attribute

of an Exit is never displayed.

In the case of a Room, the @ENTER Attribute is displayed when you FIRST

ENTER a Room, before the Name of the Room, it's Description, etc. It isn't

shown again, even when you LOOK, until you somehow go into that Room again.

The ENTER Attribute is shown to whoever's doing the ENTERing. The OENTER

Attribute is shown to others in the Room.

@ENTER HERE = You stumble past the vines and leaves and come into the open.

For Players and Objects, the ENTER command is printed to who or whatever

ENTERs that Player/Object. Other than that, it functions the same.

@ENTER Bucket = You crawl happily into the bucket, which can BARELY fit you.

NOTE: The ENTER attribute is shown to you REGARDLESS of how you enter the

Location, whether by @TELEPORTing, ENTERing or LEAVEing somewhere

else, or going through ANY exit leading in.

TinyTIM Help Topic:

COMMAND: @OENTER



@OENTER <Thing> = <Message>

Sets the message that is printed when <Thing> is ENTERed.

It's displayed to other people inside the <Thing>.

To enter an Object or Player, type ENTER <Object/Player>.

Note that going through an exit is not "Entering" that exit.

There actually isn't any way to "Enter" an Exit or Room, so

setting the OENTER isn't going to do much.

Abe Vigoda Memorial Lecture Hall

The campus' main lecture hall is wide and spacious, with rows of uncomfortable seats inclining downward towards the wooden podium. Whiteboards, covered with indecipherable scribbles, line the back wall, and a globe (globe?) of TIM rests to the podium's right. Pieces of paper and empty drink cups litter the floor beneath the seats.

TIM University - the Quad

Across the pleasant green rectangle of the campus Quad stroll a number of alternately bookish and slacker-looking students. In the center of the Quad stands a large bronze statue of TIM gazing sternly off into the horizon. Rough path-like brown patches run across the ordinarily-green grass marking common student routes.

From here, the Academic Complex is north. The Administration tower leers off to the east, with the Campus Center south. The large foofball field lies to the east, while the dorm complex is southwest. Fraternity Row runs off to the northwest.

Across the back wall is a giant logo of the school's mascot, the "Fightin' Amish".
