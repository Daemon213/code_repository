@dig/teleport Entryway - Dark Angel Studio
@Desc here=[space(5)]Cool, climate-controlled air swirls past you at a comfortable 70 degrees as you come into the Entryway of Dark Angel Studio. Several desks have been arranged behind privacy baffles, leaving a cleared walkway that seems to lead to the Sound Stage doors. Security guards stand at attention in the corners, guns discreetly tucked at their hips. Benches are arranged near the exit for visitors to use ('tablehelp').

@dig/teleport Gym - Dark Angel Tower
@Desc here=This large room is at least forty by sixty feet, with twenty feet high walls. The walls are a slightly irridescent shade of while, a shade that is quite relaxing to your eyes. Black rubber matting extends along the entire floor, which is divided into three rough 'areas'. The first is for weight-training, the second for aerobics and the third contains a selection of simulators (use +view for more). The long wall opposite the entrance is surfaced with gleaming mirrors, each one freshly polished. 
&VIEW_WEIGHTS here=%rThis area is set up as a weight-training circut. A series of universal machines, a long rack of free weights, and several odd-looking imported machines are all assembled in a logical progression. 
&VIEW_AEROBICS here=%rThe mats here are stippled with a series of bright yellow lines, marking the spaces for regular and step-aerobics. Stacked along one wall are a row of boxy step units, each one slightly scuffed looking from frequent use. 
&VIEW_SIMULATORS here=%rLined up with military precision against the far wall are a neat row of exersize machines. Treadmills, Nordic Tracks, rowing machines, and others are included to subsitute for the sort of exersize most 'city' people don't get. 
&JUDGENOTE here=The exercise equipment is all maintained properly, and repaired or replaced as needed. The mirrors are covered with a thin, transparent layer of Lexan (plexi-glass) to help protect from shattering - increases diff by 2.

@dig/teleport Conference Room - Dark Angel Tower
@Desc here=[space(5)]This is a large conference hall. It has a small stage at one end that stands two feet off the ground. There is a podium and microphone on this stage. Behind the stage to both sides are two large speakers. The walls and ceiling here look very thick, and appear to be soundproof. Rows of support pillars for the large level above break up the space. There are also two side tables and about fifty chairs, in five rows of ten facing the stage. The walls are painted blue, as is the ceiling. Other than that, this room is quite unremarkable.

&APPROVAL here=This room and all its exits were approved by Maleficient: Fri May 10 12:11:39 1996 
&VIEW_DOOR here=%rYou notice a colorful poster, depicting Tina Parker, the former Japanese World Champion Kickboxer doing her famous Whirlwind Combo on an unfortunate opponent. Her face seems grim, and she looks very intense, as she does her job.
&VIEW_LETTER here=%rFramed over the desk is a letter on 'Dark Angel Productions' stationary. It reads:%r%r%tMy Dear Gislin:%r%rEnclosed is my draft of our new film, "The Fallen". I am sorry I have not been in contact much, but problems of a somewhat political nature have been keeping this poor Dancer busy. I hope you like the draft, and we'll talk soon.%r%rLove,%rLexi%r%r(This letter is dated a week before the fire that took the life of Alexi Tsaroff).%r 
@Odrop here=enters from the room behind the Steel Door. 
&VIEW_PLAQUE here=%r[space(5)]On the wall with the bathroom door is a subtly-lit large wood-backed plaque of some silver metal. Arranged on its front is a triptych of publicity stills for 'Kiss of the Vampyre'. To either side are closeup portraits of Gislin Dahl as the vampiress Nikki Romanov, the first a shot of Nikki watching her prey, a fleeting, candid glimpse of the predatory hunger within her eyes caught forever. The second closup is of Nikki in combat, moving to attack, the cold, powerful intensity of her gaze, and the graceful assurance of her carriage vivid, almost alive.%r[space(5)]The centerpiece is of Nikki standing over the fallen Duke, her Pack in train as she addresses the cowed assembly. Skin almost glowing, flush with the sweet blush of victory, her aura of dominance and complete authority wreathed about her like a cloak, still clearly palpable. 
&VIEW_DRAWING here=%rImpressivly framed in brushed silver is a child's crayon drawing. It's a picture of three circles of various colors, each projecting four lines. They're almost like a set of flattened 4-legged stools. One is purple scribbled over with green (labeled 'Regan'), another royal blue scribbled over with the same color (labeled 'Angel'), and the final yellow scribbled over with turquoise (labeled 'Gislin'). A wavy green line along the bottom seems to represent grass, while a golden circle with dozens of staggered lines radiating from it is the sun. 
&DESC-SPARE here=[space(5)]The ceiling here is about seven feet high, and is painted matte black. There's a perfect patch of bright blue sky during day or starry moonscape at night captured by a skylight cut into the ceiling. Through a slightly ajar door you see a tidy bathroom. Most striking is the strange artwork that covers each wall surface completely. The mural is a collection of wolves that flow and blend into each other. There is an arctic wolf chasing a white rabbit; a grey wolf standing majestically on a ledge overlooking a waterfall; a black wolf, almost invisible, stalking a shadow down a city block, and many more. All in all, while this room may be the smallest in the Tower, it's also be the most remarkable. 
@Desc here=[space(5)]The empty room has been damaged recently, in a fire. Construction is underway to repair the damage. It appears nothing of value was burnt. 
&JUDGENOTE-SECURITY here=This building has a security system (#8096/security) and (#8096/sec2) as well as (#8096/fire) fire alarms. The windows (and skylight) are barred from the outside, and have additional security (#8096/windows). The door to the street has superior security (#8096/door_out). There is one security guard per floor in this building. There is a panic button (#8096/panic) near each guard station. This building passes all requirements for commercial zoning, and includes handicapped access.
&VIEW_POEM here=%rProtected by a heavy black metal frame is a poem, if you can dignify the ridiculous collection of words with that description.%r%r[space(5)]Your face is like a rose, it's beautiful%r[space(5)]Your hair is like grass, it grows really fast.%r[space(5)]Your nose is so cute, do you play the flute?%r[space(5)]Why do you go to other men, when you know the truth?%r[space(5)]Come to me, I'm a real sleuth.%r%rThis unique work has been signed with the name 'Fred Phillips'.%r

@dig/teleport Training Hall - Dark Angel Tower
@Desc here=This room is well lit, and is impressive compared to the stark reception room. Its dimensions are forty feet by sixty feet. The walls extend at least twenty feet off the matted floor, and they're painted a slightly irridescent white. On each wall, you notice a different mural (+view to see). This room is a room for the strong of heart. Only the weak will turn away. 
&APPROVAL here=This room and all its exits were approved by Maleficient: Fri May 10 12:12:30 1996 
&VIEW_GREEN here=On the wall to your right, there is a painting of a green dragon, in flight, holding a magnificent katana in its talons. On this side of the room, there is alot of gymnist equipment, highbars, horses, and spring vaults. There is also a rack of boken practice swords, made of fine quality wood. 
&VIEW_BLUE here=On the wall to your left, is a picture of a blue dragon, sitting atop a pile of bones. The dragon looks extremely menacing and sinister. It sits there with a pride that is apparent from its reptilian features. On this side of the gym, there is an obstacle course set up. It looks rather difficult, and a sign advises that no one less than a brown belt try it. Also along this wall, are pamphlets, telling of ancient Japanese culture. 
&VIEW_BLACK here=On the wall behind you, is a black dragon. The dragon is seen crawling through a midnight forest, it's muscles rippling. By this wall, there are four full sets of weights, including all types of universal and nautilus equipment. There are instructions posted next to each one, showing its proper use, and the results.
&VIEW_RED here=What really attracts your attention, however, is the far wall. A red dragon faces you, it's mouth wide open. It looks beautiful, yet quite deadly. Where it's mouth should be, are steel 'fangs' supporting small batons. On either side of this dragon are two boxing rings, complete with pads and equipment. Also along this wall are a row of staffs of various lengths, all of them with padded ends. 
&JUDGENOTE here=The equipment is all scrupulously maintained, and repaired or replaced when needed. The murals are covered over with a special layer of clear latex protectant. If they're vandilized, it will clean away without damaging them.

@dig/teleport Reception Hall - Dark Angel Tower
@Desc here=[space(5)]This is a reception hall. There is a reception desk in the center of the room, which looks to be fairly new. Seated behind the desk is a young woman, probably still in high school. Her face is hidden behind the latest issue of 'Teen Magazine'. You notice she's wearing a green shirt, monagrammed with with "Dark Angel Tower" in white, and a name tag that identifies her as 'Carrie'. In each of the corners, rest three-branched brass candlesticks holding five-foot jasmine-scented tapers. Aside from a row of small, barred windows, and a desklamp on the desk, the candles are the only other source of light in the room. To the left of the entrance are two varnished wooden benches that match the plank wood floor. The walls are painted a soothing light green. The ceiling is about twenty feet high, and is matte grey stucco. %r[space(5)]The only decorative features in this room are the logos on the wooden doors, and a map on one wall <+VIEW MAP>.

In each of the corners, rest three-branched brass candlesticks holding five-foot jasmine-scented tapers. Aside from a row of small, barred windows, and a desklamp on the desk, the candles are the only other source of light in the room.

@Desc Brandon=%rBrandon is a slightly shorter-than-average man in his late twenties or possibly early thirties. His exact age is difficult to pinpoint because he has the smooth, ageless look gifted from a partial Asian ethnicity. His dark eyes scan the room alertly, as he mediates bouts or instructs the senior students. His very stillness is that of the coiled spring, of the crouched tiger. Occasionally, he paces through the room, his white gi whispering with the movements. Rather than a traditional karate or judo belt, his gi jacket is knotted closed with a length of rope. Since he's primarily a kickboxing instructor, he prolly wears the gi more for comfort than as a uniform. If questioned about his name, he simply responds that he's Brandon Lee, no relation to the dead one.
@Adesc Brandon=@pemit %#=%rOOC information: Brandon has a Brawl of 4, and Melee of 3. His physical stats are comporable, as well. There's some simple code in place, so you can 'train' with him if one of the PC instructers isn't available.;@pemit owner(me)=<%N looked at [name(me)]>

&WINDOWS sec=All windows in this building are set with breakage detectors, that alert the security sysetm automatically if the window is broken or opened.
&DOORS_OUT sec=All doors to the ouside of this building are rigged with breakage detectors on the locks and hinges. All doors to the outside of this building are locked with a top quality deadbolt lock, Dif 8(Sec Sys) or Dif 7(Lockpick). Plus, the doors are internally reinforced with long, thick steel bars. They require a greater-than-5 strength to break (starting diff 9 for a 6, diff -1 per additional point of strength). After the lock is opened, not broke, the opener has 20 IC seconds to enter a personal code into an electronic keypad. There are no warnings to do this. Any false code will alert police, while appearing to disarm the system.
&PANIC sec=This is a panic button that alerts the building sec sys to call police with a single touch. Police should respond quickly to this, as it would be assumed that there was an intruder in the building.
&FIRE sec=This system has smoke detectors, Per 6, in each room to detect fires. They will set off the interior sprinkler system when tripped.
&DOORS_IN sec=All interior doors (if any) between rooms are set with top quality deadbolt locks, Diff 8 (Sec Sys) or Diff 7(Lockpick). They are double-key deadbolts (both sides require a key rather than a knob on one side). If the security system is active (assumed on during non-business hours appropriate to the building), breakage detectors will be active on the locks and hinges. After the lock is opened, not broke, the opener has 20 IC seconds to enter a personal code into an electronic keypad. There are no warnings to do this. Any false code will alert police, while appearing to disarm the system.
&INFRA-RED sec=Multiple infra-red cells are assembled in this open passageway to block a slightly staggard line from the top to the bottom. Nothing larger than a rat may pass without triggering the alarm silently. Security guards know how to disable and re-enable to allow them to pass on their normal rounds. This is only enabled outside normal business hours.
&SECURITY sec=This building has a high-end security system. It is installed into the walls, the windows and doors of this building. A series of generators supplies power, should the building power go off. Two high resistance surge suppressors protect the system from overload.This system will call police should any of the alarms go off; windows, doors, or code. This call is automated on a direct cellular link that is turned on by the system only if the alarms are tripped, autodialing police, or medical/fire if that code is punched in to any of the keypads around the building, or if the smoke detectors pick up smoke. The alarm to the police is silent, unless the panic button is used, in which case a high volume alam goes off. The same alarm goes off in case of a fire. Additional security notes can be found in the atrribute 'sys2' on this object. Please check it.
&SEC2 sec=Security cameras are hidden in EVERY room of EVERY building including the bathrooms, though they arn't pointed towards the toilets. There are enough cameras arranged to get a clear view of all activities in the room. They run 24/7, and the tapes are stockpiled for 1-2 IC months before being recycled (unless evidence on them is needed, obviously). The tapes are b&w. Remote security guards monitor camera images, and can trigger any alarm necessary from their location. Exterminators thoroughly inspect and clean each room once per IC month, usually under supervision. Each building is additionally 'sealed' (maintained) enough to keep most rodents and pests out. Water and gas mains are specially self-contained. They have their own direct connections to public accesses, without linking to other buildings close to the site. Other common security measures (waste management/document shredding/etc) in place as well.

@dig/teleport Training Hall - Dark Angel Tower
@Desc here=This room is well lit, and is impressive compared to the stark reception room. Its dimensions are forty feet by sixty feet. The walls extend at least twenty feet off the matted floor, and they're painted a slightly irridescent white. On each wall, you notice a different mural (+view to see). This room is a room for the strong of heart. Only the weak will turn away. &APPROVAL here=This room and all its exits were approved by Maleficient: Fri May 10 12:12:30 1996
&VIEW_GREEN here=On the wall to your right, there is a painting of a green dragon, in flight, holding a magnificent katana in its talons. On this side of the room, there is alot of gymnist equipment, highbars, horses, and spring vaults. There is also a rack of boken practice swords, made of fine quality wood.
&VIEW_BLUE here=On the wall to your left, is a picture of a blue dragon, sitting atop a pile of bones. The dragon looks extremely menacing and sinister. It sits there with a pride that is apparent from its reptilian features. On this side of the gym, there is an obstacle course set up. It looks rather difficult, and a sign advises that no one less than a brown belt try it. Also along this wall, are pamphlets, telling of ancient Japanese culture.
&VIEW_BLACK here=On the wall behind you, is a black dragon. The dragon is seen crawling through a midnight forest, it's muscles rippling. By this wall, there are four full sets of weights, including all types of universal and nautilus equipment. There are instructions posted next to each one, showing its proper use, and the results.
&VIEW_RED here=What really attracts your attention, however, is the far wall. A red dragon faces you, it's mouth wide open. It looks beautiful, yet quite deadly. Where it's mouth should be, are steel 'fangs' supporting small batons. On either side of this dragon are two boxing rings, complete with pads and equipment. Also along this wall are a row of staffs of various lengths, all of them with padded ends. &JUDGENOTE here=The equipment is all scrupulously maintained, and repaired or replaced when needed. The murals are covered over with a special layer of clear latex protectant. If they're vandilized, it will clean away without damaging them. &JUDGENOTE-SECURITY here=This building has a security system (#8096/security) and (#8096/sec2) as well as (#8096/fire) fire alarms. The windows (and skylight) are barred from the outside, and have additional security (#8096/windows). The door to the street has superior security (#8096/door_out).
