\
@@ The dbref #'s of the different rooms/objects are provided on the top of each in this log so that you can @edit the\

@@ The character sheets now have their own object *just* for the formatting commands. This makes it easier to edit/maintain.\
@@ However, the sheets are a bit broken as I'm still in 'transition' between old sheet functions and new ones. The basics\
