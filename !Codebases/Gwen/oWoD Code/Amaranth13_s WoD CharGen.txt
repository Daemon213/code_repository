@pemit me=\{Link the veteran chargen to the room you dug the step by step chargen from as well, and @open an exit to the parroom too. everyone should be able to enter the veteran chargen and parroom, as long as you don't type 'begin' it has no consequences. You need to make sure any background code you use does not use 'backg' or 'background' or any kind of combination with 'backg*' to save backgrounds on a person, because that is used for the backgrounds in the sheet. The +approve is based on a backgroundcode that saves text background as bg_1 and bg_2 and so forth. Also you will need to chose a language system or tell players you will not worry about a language system and change +language in the parroom to reflect this. To make +approve work you need to set up mail aliases with the names of each of the races, so a mailalias *vampire and one *changeling and so forth, so the wizzes will recieve the mails. Put the Character Data Lists in a safe place, the gamesystem object and the Staff Globals in the Master Room and your chargen will be set. '+code/help' '+list commands' and '+stats/help' will give some information on how or what. To lock the system to players you will have to check exactly how your version of mux or mush locks attributes to wizzes only. Each of the existing stats will need to be locked, cause they are not kept in a list on the character. see '+stats/help' for more info.\}\
