@@   For the love of God, don't delete any of these attributes. Except aspects above 2. Those are fine to delete.\
@@   Bio Fields: These are pretty much freeform. The system checks to make sure they exist and then demands that the player provide some input for each one. When the user fills out a field, the system will check for a limit attribute related to the field. The limit attribute should be a pipe-delimited list of valid answers. Note that a lot of bio fields in various settings (like the clan example, below), could (or should) be rolled into High Concept or another aspect. For games like DFRPG, Template counts as a bio field.\

@@   Skill Points: Total number of skill points allocated. If the number of skill points doesn't fit into a perfect pyramid and &pyramid is set to 1, the system will not allow characters to spend all of their skill points. Perfect pyramids: 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, etc. Games will want either 20 or 35.\

@@   Skill Pyramid: 0 or 1 depending on whether or not characters will be forced to organize their skills into a pyramid.\
@@   Free Stunts: The number of stunts that a character can have without spending any refresh.\
@@   Custom Stunts: Stunts are meant to be made up, but this option exists in case someone wants to disable customs. 0 or 1 for off and on; on is default.\
@@   Refresh: The starting refresh for a character.\
@@   Extras: Many games will need powers and/or other extras on the sheet. The &extra attributes are an expansible system that allow for additional sheet sections. By default, the generator just draws from the list of powers, charges that amount of refresh or power points, and adds to the character's sheet. More complex operations (like coding DFRPG's focus items) can be added as needed.\
@@   Powers Cost Refresh: 0 or 1 depending on whether buying powers (the default category of extras) decreases a character's refresh, or they come out of a different pool. For free powers, enter them into the system with a cost of 0.\
@@   Power Allotment: In the case that powers come out of a pool other than refresh, these attributes define the name of the alternative pool and the size of that pool. If &extra-1-cost-refresh is 0, this pool should be non-zero. For stylistic reasons (consistency with the game material, mostly), the name should be lower-case (sheets and such can be coded to capitalize it when necessary).\

&aspect-1.desc Chargen Data=Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about - who he is and what he does. It's an aspect, one of the first and most important ones for your character.%r%rThink of this aspect like your job, your role in life, or your calling - it's what you're good at, but it's also a duty you have to deal with, and it's constantly filled with problems of its own. That is to say, it comes with some good and some bad. There are a few different directions you can take this:%r%r * You could take the idea of "like your job" literally:\'a0%xhLead Detective%xn,\'a0%xhKnight of the Round%xn,\'a0%xhLow-level Thug%xn.%r%r * You could throw on an adjective or other descriptor to further define the idea:\'a0%xhDespicable Regent of Riverton%xn,\'a0%xhReluctant Lead Detective%xn,\'a0%xhAmbitious Low-level Thug%xn.%r%r * You could mash two jobs or roles together that most people would find odd:\'a0%xhWizard Private Eye%xn,\'a0%xhSinging Knight of the Round Table%xn,\'a0%xhMonster-slaying Accountant%xn.%r%r * You could play off of an important relationship to your family or an organization you're deeply involved with (especially if the family or organization are well-connected or well-known):\'a0%xhBlack Sheep of the Thompson Family%xn,\'a0%xhLow-level Thug for the Syndicate%xn,\'a0%xhScar Triad's Patsy in Riverton%xn.%r%rThese aren't the only ways to play with your high concept, but they'll get you started. But don't stress out over it - the worst thing you can do is make it into too big of a deal. You'll come up with four other aspects after this one - you don't have to get it all nailed right now.%r%rHigh concepts can have overlap among the characters, as long as you have something to distinguish how your character is different from the others.\
&aspect-2.desc Chargen Data=\
&aspect-3.desc Chargen Data=The first phase is your character's first true adventure - his first book, episode, case, movie, whatever - starring him.%r%rThen, you need to think up and write down the basic details of this story for the phase's summary. The story doesn't need to have a lot of detail\'97in fact, a pair of sentences works pretty well\'97because your fellow players will add in their own details to this past adventure in the next two phases (as you will to theirs).%r%rIf you find yourself stuck, look to your character's high concept and trouble. Find a dilemma that has a chance of throwing those ideas into focus. What problem do you get roped into because of your high concept or trouble? How does the other aspect help or complicate your life?\
