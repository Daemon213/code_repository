&DESC1 Armand=A quiet, young man in his early twenties. His short hair is a raven-black and slicked back on his head. His eyes are a deep brown and belie a deep person. He is dressed simply in all black, his only jewelry is a silver cross on a chain around his neck. As you look him over he flashes a pouty smile, with his full, black-painted lips, then goes back to cleaning glasses.%r
