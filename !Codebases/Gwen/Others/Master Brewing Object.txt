&DESC_BASIC Master Brewing Object=This is a 5-gallon glass carbouy. This can be used for brewing wine or mead. You may type 'carbouy help' to get brewing information.\
&HELP Master Brewing Object=$carbouy help:@pemit\'a0%N=Welcome to the Master Brewing Object. You may want to check 'brewing help' to review some basic brewing concepts.%r%rOthwise, the following options are available:%r%rCHECK CARBOUY: displays the status of the carbouy and the fermentation process.%rADD <what> <quantity>: Adds <what> to the carbouy. Use CHECK CARBOUY to see what's been added. You can add MUST, YEAST, or FOOD (nutrient).%r%rMAKE MUST [MEAD/WINE] [QUANTITY] <FLAVOR> - Adds 'quantity' of mead or wine to water, along with an acid blend, and brings the mixture to a boil before filling the carbouy.%r%rCLEAN CARBOUY: Cleans and sanitizes the equiptment, making it ready for the next batch.%r%rFILL [BOTTLE/CASE/CASK] <qty>: Stops the fermenting process (if any is going on), filters's the must, and fills either 1 'case' or <qty> 'bottles'. One carbouy fills the equivalent of a case (24 'bottles' or 4 'casks'.%r \{for more help 'carbouy help2'\}\
&BREW_HELP Master Brewing Object=$brewing help:@pemit\'a0%N=The process of winemaking is basically the same, no matter what ingredients are being used. The basic brewing procedure is dependant on a few variables:%r%rTemperature- the single most important factor is temperature, from start to finish. The temperature of the must (the liquid mixture before it turns into the final product) controls the rate of fermentation. If the temp is too warm, it could kill the yeast. If the fermentation stalls, the temp could be too cold.%r%rYeast- The yeast you add to your must gives the product it's alcohol content. Heartier yeasts, such as champagne yeast, will use more of the available sugar to create a higher alcohol content. Champagne yeast is more resistant to alcohol poisoning, and can result in a stronger, drier product, for example. Different yeasts prefer different fermentation temps.\
&HELP2 Master Brewing Object=$carbouy help2:@pemit\'a0%n= Carbouy Help, continued:%r%rMore Commands:%r%rThe following defaults can be set using 'SET <what>=<attr>':%r(Attributes can be found by 'display'ing the appropriate catalog (see below))%r%rPRODUCT: May be WINE or MEAD of <attr> type.%rYEAST: Set yeast type <attr>.%rGOODIES: Adds <attr> to the must during an appropriate time. If only <attr> is used to make the must, an appropriate ammount of sugar will be added. Only <attr>'s with a sugar content can be used this way.%r%rDISPLAY [HONEY|GRAPES|YEAST|GOODIES]: Shows a list of items you can use for brewing.\
