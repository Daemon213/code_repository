  Purchasing Equipment:

  +equipment/list [<category>] 
  +equipment/info <item>  
  +equipment/search <field>=<data>  
  +equipment/request <item>[=<justification>]

  All equipment commands may be abbreviated to +eq. Most equipment commands
  allow partial matching, so '/info Glock 22' and '/info Ranged Weapons/
  Glock 22' show the same item, but just typing '/info Glock' isn't specific
  enough.

  These commands let you look through the equpiment database and request
  items. The first command by itself will show you a list of equipment
  categories, and you may add a category name to list everything in that
  category. You can also '+equipment/list all', although this is quite
  spammy!
                                                                            
  Once you've found a piece of equipment that looks interesting, you can
  use +equipment/info to view its data. This will display each info type
  for that item with its data. You can also search the database by these
  info categories. For example, '+eq/search cost=2' will show you all
  items with a Resource cost of 2. Searching 'name=e' will show you all
  items with an 'e' in the name. Searching for 'damage=9-again' will show
  you all items whose damage has the 9-again effect.                                

  When you're ready to request an item, consider how your character is      
  getting it. If you're buying it with your own money, use +eq/request
  and your purchase will go through the Resource system. If it's
  something that's given to you, or something you're getting through
  other channels than paying money for it, use a regular +request.
  Justifications are optional, and intended for unusual equipment.

  Managing Your Equipment:                                                  
                                                                            
  +equipment [<item>]                                                       
  +equipment/transfer <number>=<player>                                     
  +equipment/show <number>=<player>                                         
                                                                            
  All equipment commands may be abbreviated to +eq. Most equipment commands 
  allow partial matching, but many commands for managing your personal      
  equipment will require you to use the equipment number. This is the number
  next to the item when you type '+equipment'. This is in case you have     
  multiples, to cut down on hitting the wrong item by mistake.              
                                                                            
  These commands let you manage your personal equipment. The first shows you
  a list of your equipment, and adding a name or item number will show you  
  that equipment's stats, along with any details specific to your personal  
  instance of that weapon (enchantments, gunsmithing, etc). If you have     
  multiple of an item you'll have to target them by number.                 
                                                                            
  You may also transfer your equipment to others. This is an IC action, and 
  all transfers are logged. The final command lets you show a piece of      
  equipment to someone else, including the staff-set details for your item, 
  but it will not show them the transfer history.

+resources

  +resources: Shows your current resource points and any pending spends.    

  +resources/pay <char>=<amount>: Allows you to give resource points to a   
  character at your location who is visible to you.                         

  +resources/log: Shows you the last 10 resource transactions in your log.  

  Your character will receive resource points on the first of each month    
  relative to their Resource level. The point breakdowns are 1, 2, 4, 20,   
  100 for Resources 1-5. You also receive 5 * Your Monthly Allowance when   
  you're first approved to represent things your character would already    
  own. Buying a Resource 1 item costs 1 point, buying a Resource 3 item     
  costs 4 points, and so forth.                                             

  Currently equipment that you purchase with your resources should go       
  through the '+eq/request' command (see +help equipment). Equipment that   
  you get through other means should be a regular +request. Pending requests
  are temporarily counted as spent points until they're approved or denied  
  in order to keep from overspending.

  +equipment/view <player>[=<item>]                                         
  +equipment/give <player>=<item>                                           
  +equipment/sell <player>=<item>=<cost>                                    
  +equipment/destroy <player>/<item number>                                 
  +equipment/detail <player>/<item number>=<details>                        
                                                                            
  These commands allow you to manage players' equipment. The first lets you 
  view a player's equipment list, and by adding an item name or number you  
  can see that particular item. This uses the same partial matching rules as
  viewing your own equipment. '+eq/view Bob=kevlar' and '+eq/view           
  Bob=armor/kevlar vest' will show you the same item. If Bob has two kevlar 
  vests, you'll have to view them by number, like '+eq/view bob=1'.         
                                                                            
  The 'give' command will issue equipment to a player, and also allows      
  partial matching. This bypasses the resource system and doesn't charge    
  them for the item, which allows you to issue equipment that they're not   
  paying for. If Bob joins RPIT and they issue him a Glock 22, you can      
  '+eq/give Bob=Glock 22'. The similar 'sell' command lets you issue        
  equipment to a player at a different cost than the default. The /destroy  
  command lets you completely delete a piece of their equipment. To avoid   
  mixups, you can only delete by item number.                               
                                                                            
  The final command lets you add details to a player's item. All Glock 22s  
  start with the same stats, but maybe Bob's Glock 22 has been enchanted by 
  EXPLODETTA, the Goddess of Hollow Point Ammunition, to always do +1 damage
  when firing hollow points. This command would allow you to note that on   
  Bob's Glock 22 without affecting every other Glock 22 in the game. The    
  detail command requires using an item number.                             
                                                                            
  Finally, note that the EQBUY bucket is only for equipment requests being  
  bought through Resources. This is because of the automated code that lets 
  you approve the job and have it automatically note them with it. Equipment
  requests that aren't for resources still belong in the EQUIP bucket.

  +equipment/addcat <category>                                              
  +equipment/addinfo <category>=<info name>                                 
  +equipment/delinfo <category>=<info name>                                 
  +equipment/add <category>=<name>                                          
  +equipment/set <item>/<info>=<value>                                      
                                                                            
  These commands let you add new equipment to the game. Every equipment item
  is part of a category, such as Ranged Weapons or Armor. You can view these
  categories with +equipment/list. The first command lets you add new       
  categories. For code reasons, it's best if category names don't contain   
  hyphens (-).                                                              
                                                                            
  The second set of commands manages category info. Each category can have  
  different info types. For example, weapons might have damage and size,    
  while vehicles will have speed and handling and so forth. This lets you   
  set the properties items will have in your new category.                  
                                                                            
  The third command lets you create a new item, and the fourth sets its     
  info. For example, '+eq/add ranged weapons=glock 22' and '+eq/set glock   
  22/damage=2(9-again)'.                                                    
                                                                            
  How equipment displays when you use the +eq/view command is governed by   
  functions on the Equipment and Resource Tracker. Each category has its own
  function, since each category has different info items. For example, all  
  ranged weapons are displayed using &FN_DISPLAY-RANGED_WEAPONS. The        
  function name must be fn.display- followed by the category name with      
  spaces replaces with underscores.

  These commands let you see and set resource data for a player. The first  
  shows you how many resource points they have on hand, and any pending     
  spends. The second lets you hand out resource points, and the third shows 
  you a character's last 10 resource log entries.

@wait 0={&D.EQ-MENTAL_EQUIPMENT-COMMUNICATIONS_HEADSET Equipment Database=Cost:2|Die Bonus:+2|Durability:0|Effect:Communications headsets keep characters in constant contact. Different varieties works over different distances, but most commercial models works over about 200 feet. A common alternative is a conference call between cellular phones and Bluetooth headsets. If the users have practiced using their headsets together, they gain the die bonus on any coordinated efforts. In the case of a teamwork action, the die bonus only applies to the final roll. If the users are unpracticed, the bonus falls to +1 and actors must make reflexive Wits + Composure rolls to participate successfully.%r%r%tAny heavy objects can obstruct a headsets signal. Anything obstructing with Durability higher than 3 requires listeners to make a Wits + Composure roll to understand shared messages.

&D.EQ-MENTAL_EQUIPMENT-CRIME_SCENE_KIT Equipment Database=Cost:2|Die Bonus:+2|Durability:2|Effect:A crime scene (or CSI) kit is a toolbox full of investigative aids such as magnifiers, fingerprinting dust, cameras, tape, testing chemicals, and sample bags. While the kits offer a die bonus to Investigation rolls, the more important benefit of the CSI kit is that it allows evidence to be moved and digested elsewhere. Properly applied, it allows investigators to do the bulk of their work off-site and at their own pace.|Size:3|Structure:2|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 03:11:33 2014
@wait 0={&D.EQ-MENTAL_EQUIPMENT-CODE_KIT Equipment Database=Cost:1|Die Bonus:+5|Durability:1|Effect:A code kit is a series of tools created for the purpose of making and interpreting a code for a specific audience. A common example is a book code, where a page, paragraph, and word from a certain book are used as the foundation for a cypher. This keeps any uninformed eyes off the intended message. In the case of a book code, a book is often chosen that all message recipients can access easily. This guarantees that the code never has to travel with the code key.%r%rA successfully designed cypher is difficult to break. The die bonus acts as a penalty to any rolls to crack the code without the necessary reference key.|Size:2|Structure:3|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 03:11:40 2014}
&D.EQ-MENTAL_EQUIPMENT-CRACKING_SOFTWARE Equipment Database=Cost:3|Die Bonus:+2|Durability:N/A|Effect:Crappy softwares a dime a dozen. Good, reliable cracking software is hard to come by. With solid software, a hacker can force passwords, breach firewalls, and otherwise make a nuisance of herself in computer systems. Beyond the dice pool modification, the benefit such software offers is a sort of buffer between the hacker and security. Any efforts to track the hacker takes two steps; one to identify the software, then one to trace it back to the source. Functionally this means two rolls on behalf of the security personnel, with an opportunity for the hacker to withdraw before detection.|Size:N/A|Structure:N/A|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 03:11:45 2014

Now, any student can carry a coin-sized device that would have put intelligence agencies of the 1980s to shame. The cheaper model of recorder gives its +1 bonus to any rolls to catch words or sounds. The bonus also applies to concealment rolls. The more expensive model gives +2.

It can reinforce barricades, stabilize weapon handles, bind prisoners, repair broken pipes, and so much more. In most cases, duct tape can offer a +1 bonus to Crafts-related rolls.

It generally does what its supposed to; it helps cut a path through the unknown. Its die bonus subtracts from any penalties due to darkness, and adds to any rolls to search in the dark. A good flashlight can serve as a club in a pinch. As well, it can blind an unfortunate subject. A Dexterity + Athletics roll, subtracting an informed opponents Defense, will put the beam where it needs to be. The victims player may make a contested Stamina roll. If your character scores more successes than the subject, theyre blinded for one turn. Victims with especially acute senses are blinded for two turns.|Size:1|Structure:3|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 03:12:35 2014
&D.EQ-MENTAL_EQUIPMENT-GLOWSTICK Equipment Database=Cost:1|Die Bonus:+2|Durability:1|Effect:Glowsticks use a chemical mixture to summon forth enough light to see in a small area. Most commercial glowsticks last a couple of hours; police and other professional varieties can last twelve. Because theyre small, airtight containers, they serve the added benefit of being useful underwater or in the rain. Functionally, they work the same as a flashlight. However, they cannot be used to blind a target, since their soft glow is far less obtrusive than a flashlights beam. Theyre also very conveniently worn, which can serve strategic purposes for a group operating in low-light conditions. A member will not go missing without being noticed so long as they have a glow-ing neon bar on their belt.|Size:1|Structure:1|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 03:12:39 2014

This is usually done to record incriminating data or passwords. Usually, keylogging software is coupled with software to transmit the data once captured. The challenge for the would-be intruder is installing the soft-ware. Email scams are an unreliable way to get onto a specific computer, but could fool one member of a large organization.

The nitrocellulose burns so fast that its not dangerous for the user. Flash paper is a common part of a magicians arsenal of tricks and was traditionally used as a flash for photography. It also serves as a highly effective ward against things intimidated by fire. Vampires, some ghosts, and many types of zombie are afraid of fire and will flee on sight. This serves the dual function of identifying such monsters in a crowd, as theyll often flinch or hiss as they resist their impulses to run or kill. %r%rWhen a creature weak against fire sees flash paper, it must succeed in a Resolve + Composure roll to resist recoiling. If the character knows what she is looking for %(that is, she lit the flash paper near the creature deliberately to check its reaction%), the player can apply a Condition such as Exposed or Shaken to the creature.|Size:1|Structure:1|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 13:01:57 2014}

@wait 0={&D.EQ-SUPERNATURAL_EQUIPMENT-ENERGY_METER Equipment Database=Cost:3|Die Bonus:+1|Durability:1|Effect:An energy meter is a device, technological or mystical, that supposedly detects the emanations of the supernatural. Some energy meters are radios tuned to a dead channel, with the variations in white noise the gauge. Some are crystals on pendulums, moving in the face of the otherworldly. Dowsing rods are another common tool used as an energy meter. %r%rUnlike an EMF detector, an energy meter detects loca-tions that are haunted or otherwise mystically charged. It works without fail when in the right places. An EMF detector picks up the traces and trails of actual entities, albeit unreli-ably. When in a place of supernatural influence, an energy meter activates without a die roll. Its die bonus applies to rolls to convince witnesses that a place is either influenced by the supernatural or absent of the supernatural. %r%rWhen procuring an energy meter, choose a type of creature. Functionally, it acts as the Unseen Sense Merit %(see p. 175 GMC%). For example, an energy meter to detect werewolves may be a holly wand dipped in silver, or a vampire-detecting meter may be a bowl of holy water that ripples when the undead approach.|Size:2|Structure:2|edited by:#3368|last edit:Sun Feb 16 12:41:07 2014}

For example, anise is good for meditation, bergamot for prosperity, myrrh for healing, and sage to ward off evil.

@wait 0={&D.EQ-SUPERNATURAL_EQUIPMENT-SALT Equipment Database=Cost:1|Die Bonus:+2|Durability:1|Effect:Salt represents purity in many cultures. This purity holds the unnatural at bay. Ethereal creatures such as ghosts and demons cannot pass through an unbroken line of salt. If all portals into a building are lined with salt, ethereal creatures cannot even force their way through walls or ceilings. %r%rIf actively used in an Abjuration %(see p. 231 GMC%), salt adds its die bonus. If a spirit tries to use Numina to break a salt line, it must spend Willpower to make the attempt and suffers the die bonus as a penalty to the activation. The Willpower does not add to the roll. %r%rIf salt is integrated into a weapon, for example in buck-shot, the weapon becomes able to harm ghosts. Any successful hit causes the ghost to lose Corpus equal to the successes rolled %(the damage rating of the weapon does not add to this%) and forces the ghost to Discorporate for that many turns. Note, however, that the weapon or ammunition doesnt stop at the ghost.

@wait 0={&D.EQ-OTHER_EQUIPMENT-GARDEN_GNOME Equipment Database=Cost:1|Die Bonus:None|Durability:2|Notes:Garden gnomes are lawn ornament figurines of small humanoid creatures known as gnomes or dwarfs that are typically males wearing red pointy hats. First created in 19th-century Germany, garden gnomes spread to other countries in Europe in the 1840s and became particularly popular in France and Britain. The term "Garden Gnome" may originate from the term "gnomen-figuren" %(miniature figurine%), used in the original German catalogues, They had a resurgence in popularity in the 1930s after Disney's animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and were revived again in the 1970s%r%rIn ancient Rome, small stone statues depicting the Greco-Roman fertility god Priapus, also a protector of plants and gardens, were frequently placed in Roman gardens. Garden gnomes were first described during the Renaissance period by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus as "diminutive figures two spans in height who did not like to mix with humans". During this period, stone "grotesques", which were typically garishly painted, metre-tall figurines, were commonly placed in the gardens of the wealthy. Among the figures depicted were gobbi %(Italian for dwarfs or hunchbacks%). In particular, Jacques Callot produced 21 versions of gobbi, which he engraved and printed in 1616. By the late 1700s, gnome-like statues made of wood or porcelain called "house dwarfs" became popular household decorations. The area surrounding town of Brienz in Switzerland was known for their production of wooden house dwarfs.%r%rIn Germany, these garden figurines became conflated with their traditional stories and superstitions about the "little folk" or dwarfs that they believed helped around the mines and on the farm. The Dresden company Baehr and Maresch had small ceramic statues of dwarfs or "little folk" in stock as early as 1841, and although the claim has been contested, some credit Baehr and Maresch with the first garden dwarfs %(German: Gartenzwerge%).%r%rReplica of Lampy, Charles Isham's 1847 terracotta gnome from Germany Within less than 10 years, statues of dwarfs had spread from the provinces of Saxony and Thuringia across Germany to France and, in 1847, Sir Charles Isham, brought 21 terracotta gnomes manufactured in Germany by Philip Griebel back to Britain where they were called "gnomes" in English and placed in the gardens of Isham's home, Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Nicknamed "Lampy", the only gnome of the original batch to survive is on display at Lamport Hall and insured for 1 million pounds.%r%rThe manufacturing of gnomes spread across Germany, with numerous other large and small manufacturers coming in and out of the business, each having its own particular style of design. From around 1860 onwards, many statues were made in Grfenroda, a town in Thuringia, known for its ceramics.%r%rThe reputation of German gnomes declined after World War I, but they became popular again in the 1930s following Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, when more working-class people were able to purchase them. Tom Major-Ball %(father of former British prime minister John Major%) was the most notable producer at that time with his company Major's Garden Ornaments. World War II and the years following were also hard on the industry, and most producers gave it up then.%r%rGarden gnomes saw a resurgence in popularity again in the 1970s with the creation of more humorous types of gnomes. In the 1990s travelling gnome and garden gnome pranks became and made national news at times, where people steal a garden gnome from an unknowing person's lawn and then send the owner photos of the gnome as a practical joke before returning it.%r%rPhilip Griebel's descendants are still producing garden gnomes in Germany. As of 2008, there were an estimated 25 million garden gnomes in Germany.|Cite:None|Size:4|edited by:#1094|last edit:Sat Feb 25 22:13:15 2017}
